"中国，韩国和日本星座具有相同的起源，并且外观非常相似。它们分别在公元8世纪的敦煌星图，天上尚乐，查邦·雅·吉多地图和公元7至8世纪绘制的Kitora天空图中表示。它们的位置和名称在中文字母中相似。星座的名称最早出现在公元前2000年的汉朝记载夏朝的史记大史中。"

"### Origin\n"
"\n"
"The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on\n"
"the _Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do_, the Korean Constellation map, which was\n"
"carved in stone 1395. The black stone plate was 122.5 cm in width, 211 cm in\n"
"height, and 12 cm in depth; the stars were highlighted in white. The map\n"
"displays 1,467 stars [#1], 264 constellations and their names, the ecliptic and\n"
"equatorial lines, and the 365 Chinese \"degrees\" of the full circle. It was\n"
"compiled as a copy of earlier Korean map (Goguryeo star map) of Chinese roots\n"
"and changed in details due to recent observations. Therefore, some stars are\n"
"engraved at their coordinates up to a millennium earlier and for some (groups\n"
"of) stars precession is applied.\n"
"\n"
"The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only about\n"
"300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the map were\n"
"drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit.\n"
"Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to the\n"
"position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered\n"
"in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be no bright\n"
"stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the author is\n"
"subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. It will\n"
"however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like.\n"
"\n"
"The origin of this Korean celestial map is another sky map which existed about\n"
"2,000 years ago, the Chinese Suzhou map (cf: Chinese sky culture). The original\n"
"Korean map grouped the 1467 stars in about 190 constellations. The shapes of\n"
"the depictions are slightly different from the Chinese ones."

"### 起源\n"
"\n"
"在这种恒星天空文化中显示的272个星座是根据韩国星座地图Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do雕刻的，它刻在石头上1395年。黑色石板宽122.5厘米，高度211厘米，深度12厘米；星星以白色突出显示。该地图显示1,467颗星星[#1]，264个星座及其名称，黄道和赤道线以及整圈的365个中国“度”。它被编译为早期的中国根朝鲜地图（高句丽星图）的副本，并由于最近的观察而在细节上有所变化。因此，某些恒星在其坐标上雕刻到一千年之前，并且对某些（成组的）恒星进行了岁差。\n"
"\n"
"对地图的解释并不容易：地图太旧了，以至于仅发现约300颗恒星与真实恒星匹配。地图上的所有星星都画在一个圆上，因此赤道似乎小于南极。因为星座图的密度相对于位置不变，所以星座图的位置和大小以作者未知的方式有所改变。假定不应该有不属于任何星座的明亮恒星。作者的作品受到解释，以后可能会更改。但是，它将大致显示朝鲜星座的面貌。\n"
"\n"
"这张韩国天球图的起源是大约2000年前存在的另一幅天空图，即中国苏州图（参见：中国天空文化）。原始的韩国地图将1467颗恒星分为大约190个星座。描绘的形状与中国的略有不同。"
