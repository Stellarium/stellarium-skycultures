"The Chinese, Korean, and Japanese constellations have the same origin and "
"look very similar in shape. They are represented respectively in the Dun "
"Huang starmap from the 8th century, the _Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Ji-Do_ "
"map and in the Kitora skymap painted in the 7th to 8th century CE. Their "
"positions and their names are similar in the Chinese alphabet. The name of "
"the constellations first appear in the Records of the Grand Historian (史記) "
"in Han dynasty describing Xia dynasty in about 2000 BCE."

"### Origin\n"
"\n"
"The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on the _Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do_, the Korean Constellation map, which was carved in stone 1395. The black stone plate was 122.5 cm in width, 211 cm in height, and 12 cm in depth; the stars were highlighted in white. The map displays 1,467 stars,[#1] 264 constellations and their names, the ecliptic and equatorial lines, and the 365 Chinese \"degrees\" of the full circle. It was compiled as a copy of earlier Korean map (Goguryeo star map) of Chinese roots and changed in details due to recent observations. Therefore, some stars are engraved at their coordinates up to a millennium earlier and for some (groups of) stars precession is applied. \n"
"\n"
"The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only about 300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the map were drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit. Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to the position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be no bright stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the author is subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. It will however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like. \n"
"\n"
"The origin of this Korean celestial map is another sky map which existed about 2,000 years ago, the Chinese Suzhou map (cf: Chinese sky culture). The original Korean map grouped the 1467 stars in about 190 constellations. The shapes of the depictions are slightly different from the Chinese ones. "
