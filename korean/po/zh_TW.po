"中國，韓國和日本星座具有相同的起源，並且外觀非常相似。它們分別在公元8世紀的敦煌星圖，天上尚樂，查邦·雅·吉多地圖和公元7至8世紀繪製的Kitora天空圖中表示。它們的位置和名稱在中文字母中相似。這些星座的名稱最早出現在公元前2000年的漢朝記載夏朝的史記大史中。"

"### Origin\n"
"\n"
"The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on\n"
"the _Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do_, the Korean Constellation map, which was\n"
"carved in stone 1395. The black stone plate was 122.5 cm in width, 211 cm in\n"
"height, and 12 cm in depth; the stars were highlighted in white. The map\n"
"displays 1,467 stars [#1], 264 constellations and their names, the ecliptic and\n"
"equatorial lines, and the 365 Chinese \"degrees\" of the full circle. It was\n"
"compiled as a copy of earlier Korean map (Goguryeo star map) of Chinese roots\n"
"and changed in details due to recent observations. Therefore, some stars are\n"
"engraved at their coordinates up to a millennium earlier and for some (groups\n"
"of) stars precession is applied.\n"
"\n"
"The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only about\n"
"300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the map were\n"
"drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit.\n"
"Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to the\n"
"position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered\n"
"in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be no bright\n"
"stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the author is\n"
"subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. It will\n"
"however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like.\n"
"\n"
"The origin of this Korean celestial map is another sky map which existed about\n"
"2,000 years ago, the Chinese Suzhou map (cf: Chinese sky culture). The original\n"
"Korean map grouped the 1467 stars in about 190 constellations. The shapes of\n"
"the depictions are slightly different from the Chinese ones."

"### 起源\n"
"\n"
"在這種恆星天空文化中顯示的272個星座是根據韓國星座地圖Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do雕刻的，它刻在石頭上1395年。黑色石板寬122.5厘米，高度211厘米，深度12厘米；星星以白色突出顯示。該地圖顯示1,467顆星星[#1]，264個星座及其名稱，黃道和赤道線以及整圈的365個中國“度”。它被編譯為早期的中國根朝鮮地圖（高句麗星圖）的副本，並由於最近的觀察而在細節上有所變化。因此，某些恆星在其坐標上雕刻到一千年之前，並且對某些（成組的）恆星進行了歲差。\n"
"\n"
"對地圖的解釋並不容易：地圖太舊了，以至於僅發現約300顆恆星與真實恆星匹配。地圖上的所有星星都畫在一個圓上，因此赤道似乎小於南極。因為星座圖的密度相對於位置不變，所以星座圖的位置和大小以作者未知的方式有所改變。假定不應該有不屬於任何星座的明亮恆星。作者的作品受到解釋，以後可能會更改。但是，它將大致顯示朝鮮星座的面貌。\n"
"\n"
"這張韓國天球圖的起源是大約2000年前存在的另一幅天空圖，即中國蘇州圖（參見：中國天空文化）。原始的韓國地圖將1467顆恆星分為大約190個星座。描繪的形狀與中國的略有不同。"
