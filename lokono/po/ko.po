"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"현대적이고 역사적으로 볼 때 천문학적 지식은 로코 노 사회의 특정 구성원들에게만 국한되지 않은 것으로 보인다. 그러나, 스타 지식의 다양한 측면을 습득해야했고, 그들과 관련된 구전 전통을 한 세대에서 다른. 1550 년경 로코 노의 첫 번째 기록 중 하나를 쓴 로드리고 데 나바 레테 (Rodrigo de Navarette)로부터 우리는 예를 들어 다음과 같이 배웁니다.“Cemetu라고 부르는 늙고 현명한 사람들은 집회를 위해 설계된 집에서 모이고 (...) 그들의 조상들과 위대한 사람들의 전통과 착취, 그리고 그 조상들이 그들의 조상들로부터들은 것을 이야기합니다. 이런 식으로 그들은 그들의 나라와 사람들의 가장 오래된 사건들을 기억합니다. 그리고 같은 방식으로 그들은 하늘, 태양, 달 및 별과 관련된 사건에 대해 이야기하거나 설교합니다.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"현대 Lokono에서 semethi로 알려진 약사 인 Navarette의 cemetu는 오늘날 그들의 관행을 크게 포기했으며, 이것이 천문 지식의 전달이 중단 된 이유 일 수 있습니다. 오늘날 많은 로코 노 별자리가 잊혀진 것 같습니다. 따라서 우리의 출처는 종종 초기 탐험가와 기아나의 민족 학자가 기록한 역사적 기록으로 제한되며, 가장 오래된 예 중 하나가 아래에 설명되어 있습니다.\n"

"로코 노의 스텔라 지식을 재구성 할 수있는 것은 바로이 문헌들입니다. 그러나 개별 천체를 논의하기 전에 Lokono 천문학의 몇 가지 일반적인 특징은 다음과 같은 언급을합니다.\n"
"\n"
"* 인접 원주민 그룹의 천문학적 전통과의 중복.\n"
"* 천체의 기원과 중요성을 설명하는 구전 전통.\n"
"* 수많은 별자리 이름에서 koya 'spirit'이라는 용어 사용.\n"
"* 일반적인 용어 wiwa '스타, 연도'및 기타 천문학 용어의 부재.\n"
"* 로코 노의 하늘 관찰 관행.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. 공유 Guianan 지식\n"
"\n"
"로코 노 영토는 언어 적으로 관련이없는 토착민 인 카리나 (Cariban)는 Cariban 언어를 사용하고 Warao는 언어 분리를 말하고 있습니다. 무관하고 전통적으로 결혼하지는 않았지만 세 그룹은 많은 물질적, 비 물질적 문화를 공유합니다. 세 민족의 민족적 천문학적 전통은 또한 공유 된 별의 신화, 별자리의 유사한 이름 및 별의 달력과 비슷한 여러 가지 놀라운 유사성을 보여줍니다. 이것은 로코 노 세 메티 (Lokono semethi)와 같은 각자의 영적 지도자에 의해 촉진 될 수있는 세 그룹 간의 접촉과 천문학적 지식의 교환과 관련이있다. 이러한 전통이 겹치는 정도와 교환의 방향성에 대한 추가 연구가 필요합니다. 우리는 로코 노에 중점을두기 때문에 로코 노 민족 지명에 대해 밝히지 않는 한 이러한 문화적 차입에 대해 자세히 논의하지 않습니다.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. 스텔라 구두 전통\n"
"\n"
"이러한 공유 기능 중 하나는 별에 대한 신화입니다. 그러한 구전 전통은 특정 천체의 기원을 말하고 서로 연결하며 자연계에 미치는 영향을 설명합니다. 예를 들어, 로코 노 별자리 히 시코 야 '검은 curassow의 정신'은 로코 노 신화와 Yokhârhin 'Hunter'및 Alêti 'Torch'의 신화와 연결되어 있으며,이 3 가지 모두 Kari'na와 Warao에 해당합니다. 의사들이 보존 한 이러한 구전 전통은 아마도 천문학적 지식이 한 세대에서 다른 세대로 전달되는 주요 수단으로 작용했을 것입니다. 이러한 이유로, 관련 신화의 요약은 특정 별자리의 설명에 나와 있습니다. 때때로, 관련 로코 노 신화가 문서화되지 않은 경우, 특정 천체의 중요성을 밝히기 위해 이웃 그룹의 신화가 언급됩니다. 로코 노와 이웃 집단이 그러한 구전 전통을 공유한다는 점을 감안할 때, 잘 보존되지 않은 로코 노 천문 지식의 이러한 향상은 정당화됩니다.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. 영혼의 달력\n"
"\n"
"일반적으로 특정 식물이나 동물에 대한 용어를 따르는 수많은 별자리 이름에서 발견되는 코야 '정신'이라는 용어는 로코 노 천문학의 주요 특징입니다. 기아나의 민족지 학자 인 월터 로스 (Walter Roth)는 그러한 별자리가 해당 존재의 영혼이라고 설명합니다. [#4] 별자리가 나타나는 연도에 영혼은 하늘에서 지구로 이동하여 생명체를 존재로 호흡합니다. 나타냅니다. 따라서 코야 별자리는 달력을 형성하여 식물과 동물과 관련된 생존 활동에 참여하기 가장 좋은 시간을 나타냅니다 (예 : 사냥 또는 수집). 로코 노는 또한 그러한 영들이 땅에서 내려 오는 곳을 알고 있었을 것입니다. 월터 로스 (Walter Roth)는 별자리와 같은 이름으로이 장소를 불렀지 만 그 증거는 여전히 나쁘다고 제안합니다. 따라서 Hadorhikoya '붉은 아 코우치의 정신'은 별자리가 나타날 때 정신, 별자리 및 hadorhi가 많이 발견되는 장소를 나타냅니다. 이 지명적인 지식은 오늘날 잊혀졌지만, 코야 별자리는 우리에게 로코 노가 가지고 있었던 식물과 동물의 삶에 대한 큰 이해를 상기시킵니다.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. 별과 연도 Wiwa\n"
"\n"
"로코 노에는 또한 별 (wiwa)을 가리키는 데 사용되는 또 다른 일반적인 용어가 있습니다. 이 용어에는 코야의 영적인 의미가 없습니다. 한편으로 그것은 별의 물리적 특성을 빛나는 것으로, 다른 한편으로는 달력 연도를 의미합니다. 예를 들어, 나이에 관해 이야기 할 때 사용됩니다. 그것은 어떤 별에도 적용될 수 있지만, wiwa는 천체의 두 가지 적절한 이름으로 만 나타납니다. 문자 그대로 '별 점수'(Pleiades) 인 요코로 위와 (Yôkoro wiwa)는 로코 노 (Rokono) 달력 연도가 전통적으로 시작되는 모든 로코 노 별자리 중 가장 중요합니다. 요코로 위와 다음에는 수많은 코야 별자리가 있으며, 각각은 로코 노 달력에서 다른 계절을 나타냅니다. 반면 Wiwa Kalemero는 문자 그대로 '빛나는 별'(Jupiter)이 밝기 때문에 단독으로 선정 된 것으로 보입니다. wiwa와 koya 외에도 Lokono 언어로 행성, 별, 달, 태양, 은하 등을 구별하는 일반적인 용어는 없습니다. 이러한 이유로, 예를 들어 은하수의 로코 노 등가물이 다른 별자리에 포함됩니다.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. 하늘 관찰 관행\n"
"\n"
"Lokono는 저녁에 하늘을 감상 할 수 있지만 Lokono의 별 달력을 따르려면 Lokono가 일반적으로 일어나는 시간 인 오전 4 시경에 별자리를 봐야합니다. Lokono는 따라서 아침에 별자리가 상승하는 것을 관찰합니다. 매년 별자리주기에 대한 올바른 아이디어를 얻으려면보기 위치를 Guianas (예 : 위치 메뉴의 Georgetown, Paramaribo 또는 Cayenne)로 설정해야합니다. 별자리를 그릴 때 많은 로코 노가 별을 선으로 연결하지 않았으며 어떤 경우에는 별자리 내의 어떤 별이 식물이나 동물의 어느 부분에 해당하는지에 대해 화자 사이에 동의가 거의 없었다는 언급이 있습니다. 스텔라 리움에서 우리는 선으로 별자리를 표현하지만, 이것은 특정 스타 그룹을 해석하는 데 더 많은 유연성을 허용하는 로코 노 전통의 왜곡 일 수 있음을 명심해야합니다. 마지막으로, 일부 천체를 보는 데는 제한이 있습니다. 왜냐하면 [#5]를 보면 첨자가 해를 끼칠 수 있다고 믿기 때문입니다. 예를 들어, 보름달에 의해 어머니들은 아이들의 눈을 가리어 아프지 않게하였습니다 [#6]. 젊은 사람들은 또한 요코로 위와 (Pleiades)를 보지 말라고 들었다. 그렇지 않으면 그들은 자라지 않을 것이다 [#7]. 이러한 관행은 강력한 영혼을 품고 있다고 생각되는 다른 물체에도 적용되었으며 고추, 라임 또는 소금을 눈에 비비는 것과 같은 영혼과의 눈 접촉을 피하는 다른 방법을 포함했습니다.\n"
"\n"
"로코 노 천체\n"
"\n"
"하달리 '일'\n"
"\n"
"태양에 대한 로코 노어 용어는 Hadali이며 Adali로 발음됩니다. Claaudius de Goeje는 Harlitvanli, Haliwalika, Halwanli, Hariwalli 및 Arawanili로 알려진 첫 번째 약사 인 Lokono 문화 영웅의 다양한 철자 이름, 때로는 Arawidi가 모두 태양과 동일한 영웅을 지칭 할 수 있음을 나타냅니다 [#8]. 이 가설을 확인할 수는 없지만 Arawidi의 신화는 언급 할 가치가 있습니다. 로코 노 신화에서 태양인 Arawidi는 별자리 Mabukuli '허벅지없는 남자'(Orion 's belt) [#9] [#10] [#11]가되는 남자의 아버지입니다. 이야기에 따르면, 태양은 Arawidi라는 사람의 모양으로 지구에 와서 쌍둥이를 낳은 연인을 만났습니다. 신화의 나중 에피소드에서 쌍둥이 중 하나는 여자와 결혼하여 어머니는 부부를 죽이기로 결정합니다. 그들이 도망치려 고 할 때, 아내의 여동생이 그들을 추격하고 그의 다리를 복수하려고합니다. 결과적으로 남자는 하늘로 올라가 별자리 마부 쿠 리가됩니다. 또 다른 로코 노의 신화는 햇볕에 무인도에 갇힌 한 남자가 태양의 기분을 상하게하는 것에 대해 경고합니다. 배가 그를지나 갔지만 배 안에는 태양이 있는데, 사람들은 항상 태양이 너무 강하게 빛나고 있다고 불평하기 때문에 사람을 돕고 싶지 않습니다 [#11]. 임 투른 (Im Thurn)은 로코 노 (Rokono)에서 태양의 일식은 하달리 (Hadali)와 카스티 (Kasti), 달과의 전쟁으로 간주되며 로코 노 (Lokono)는 소리를 멈추고 모든 종류의 소음을 차단할 것이라고 말했다. 싸움 [#12].\n"
"\n"
"캐시 '달'\n"
"\n"
"달은 1598 년경 Joannes de Laet에 의해 cattehee로 처음 기록 된 용어 인 Kathi로 알려져 있으며, 달의 달 [#13]을 나타내는 데 사용됩니다. 로코 노에 따르면, 달은 태양처럼 한때 사람이었다. 월터 로스 (Walter Roth)는 로코 노 (Rokono) 신화에 대해보고합니다. 로코 노 (Rokono) 신화는 밤새 신비로운 연인이 방문한 젊은 여성 [#10]입니다. 연인이 누군지 알아 내기 위해 여자는 냄비 바닥에서 그을음으로 손을 닦았습니다. 다음날, 그녀는 일어 났을 때 그녀의 동생의 얼굴이 그을음으로 덮여 있음을 발견하고 밤에 그녀를 방문한 사람임을 깨달았습니다. 그녀의 지역 사회의 모든 사람들은 근친상간 형제를 피하기 시작했습니다. 그는 부끄러워서 사람들로부터 멀리 떨어져 하늘로 올라가 달이되었습니다. 로코 노에 따르면, 오늘 달의 얼굴이 더럽습니다. 달은 또 다른 신화에도 나타납니다. 위에서 언급 한 무인도에 갇힌 한 남자에 대한 로코 노의 신화에서 다른 배가 그 남자를 추월하지만, 이번에는 달이 있는데, 사람들은 밤에 달이 나오는 것을 항상 기뻐하기 때문에 남자를 돕기로 결정합니다. RefX11]. 달과 태양도 상대로 묘사됩니다. 로코 노는 예전에는 달의 일식이 죽음 (카티 온 '달 죽어가는 달)'이라고 믿고 밤새 계속 지켜 볼 것이라고 말했다. [#6] 로코 노는 달의 일식 중에 달이 잠 들었다고 말한다. 태양의 경로 [#11]. 따라서 그들은 많은 소음을 내고 드럼을 연주하며 셸 트럼펫을 날려 깨 웁니다. 보름달이되면 어머니는 자녀의 눈을 가리고 아프지 않게되었습니다.\n"
"\n"
"Warhokoma '금성'\n"
"\n"
"모닝 스타로 아침에 나타날 때와 저녁 스타로 저녁에 나타날 때 모두 금성 행성은 로코 노 [#8] [#14] [#15]에 의해 Warhokoma라고 불립니다. 반면 Charles Dance는 Eweiwah와 Huewah라는 용어를보고합니다. 아마 wiwa라는 일반 용어와 같습니다.\n"
"빛나는 천체 [#16]에 사용할 수있는 '별'. 로코 노는 또한 금성을 히야로 위와 '여성 스타'라고 말합니다. 이와 관련하여 Claudius de Goeje는 Hiyaro wiwa가 달 가까이에 나타나고 소녀가 첫 월경을 시작하려고 할 때 Lokono는 소녀가 곧 달에 닿을 것이라고 말합니다. [#5]. 구체적으로 Warhokoma에 대한 신화와 달과의 관계에 대한 신화는 없지만 Lokono는 달이 원래 그의 여동생과 근친상간을 범한 사람 이었다는 이야기를 알고 있음을 상기 할 가치가 있습니다 (Kathi에서 언급 한 신화 참조). 여성화 기 [#10]라는 이름을 가지고 있습니다. 흥미롭게도, 아침이나 저녁 별의 이름 인 Warhokoma는 Kari'na에도 나타나며, 달의 아내 [#17] [#18]로도 알려져 있습니다.\n"
"\n"
"와야 누 쿠티 부 나하 '밀키 웨이'\n"
"\n"
"은하수는 로코 노인들에게 문자 그대로 Waya nukuthi bunaha로 알려져 있습니다.\n"
"‘점토 운반 대 경로’ 은하수는 한때 냄비를 만들기 위해 점토를 가져간 사람들의 발자국을 나타냅니다.이 예술은 오늘날 Lokono가 거의 사용하지 않는 예술입니다. 그러나 이름의 기원은 여전히 알려져 있으며 신화 [#19]로 요약되어 있습니다. 은하수 (Wilky Way)와 같은 이름은 William Brett에 의해 언급되었는데, 그는 그것이 희끄무레 한 유형의 점토 [#14]의 이름을 따서 명명되었다고 덧붙였다. 반면에 찰스 댄스는 은하수가 점토를 뿌리는 족제비의 발자국을 나타내고 월터 로스는 다른 로코 노의 설명을 언급하며, 이에 따라 은하수는 개와 재규어가 쫓는 테이퍼를 나타낸다고한다 [#10] [#16]. 그러나이 두 출처는 은하수에 해당하는 로코 노 이름을 제공하지 않으며,이 두 설명은 은하의 내에서 테이퍼 별자리에 따라 호랑이 별자리를 인식하는 카리나 영향 일 가능성이 있습니다 방법 [#17].\n"
"\n"
"말리 '시리우스'\n"
"\n"
"현대의 로코 노는 시리우스 말리 (Sirius Mali)라고하며, 그 의미는 알려져 있지 않습니다. 코넬리우스 반 콜은 말리 (Mali)라고 불리는 로코 노의 별을 묘사하며이 별이 매우 강력한 별이라고 말한다 [#7] [#17]. 8 월 아침에 일어 났을 때 늪에서 물고기를 죽이고, 그것을 겨냥해서는 안됩니다. 그렇지 않으면 손가락이 절름발이가됩니다. 코넬리우스 반 콜 (Cornelius van Coll)의 말리 (Mali)는 말리 (Mali)에서 유래 된 용어 인 로코 노 말리 살리 테스 (Lokono malidalithe)에서 불린 큰 건기 (8 월에서 12 월)의 시작을 표시합니다. 오래된 소식통은 말리를 잠정적으로 Lyra, Aquila 또는 Crux로 식별했지만 8 월경에 큰 건기가 시작되고 Lokono가 아침에 별을 관찰한다는 점을 감안할 때 이러한 식별 정보는 정확하지 않아야합니다. 현재 Lyra, Aquila 및 Crux는 Lokono 지역 [#11] [#17]에서 볼 수 없습니다. 말리에 대한 로코 노 신화는 없지만 카리나 별자리 옴 바타 포에 해당하는 증거가 있습니다.\n"
"‘이전 얼굴’ 카리나 신화는 로코 노 말리처럼 늪에서 물고기를 죽이고 큰 건기의 시작을 알리는 별자리의 기원과 이름을 설명합니다. 또한 Kari'na Ombatapo는 Puppis 및 Canis Major의 일부로 식별되며 후자는 Sirius [#18] [#20]를 포함합니다."
