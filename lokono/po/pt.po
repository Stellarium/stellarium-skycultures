"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"

"Os Lokono, também conhecidos como Ararawak, são um povo indígena das Guianas, cujo território se estende ao longo da costa do Oceano Atlântico, do noroeste da Guiana, através do Suriname, até o noroeste da Guiana Francesa (ver mapa) [#1]. Os Lokono falam uma língua que pertence à família de línguas arawakanas, um dos maiores grupos linguísticos do continente. Como muitos de seus parentes lingüísticos, os Lokono são agricultores especializados no cultivo da mandioca (Manani esculenta), que também praticam pesca, caça e coleta de plantas silvestres. No entanto, como um dos primeiros grupos indígenas encontrados pelos europeus na época da conquista, os Lokono estão em contato com populações não indígenas há mais de 500 anos [#2]. Esse contato se intensificou no século passado, levando a uma perda substancial da língua Lokono, material tradicional e cultura imaterial, mudanças nas práticas de subsistência e, em particular, ao desaparecimento de _medicine-men_, os veículos tradicionais de conhecimento espiritual, provavelmente incluindo conhecimentos etnoastronômicos.\n"
"\n"
"Como conseqüência, o conhecimento moderno sobre corpos celestes parece ser apenas uma fração do que os Lokono sabiam sobre estrelas no passado. Várias constelações mencionadas em fontes mais antigas são esquecidas ou são conhecidas apenas por seus nomes, enquanto as combinações de estrelas que representam e as tradições orais que explicam sua origem e significado foram esquecidas.

"Conhecimento astronômico Lokono: uma introdução\n"
"\n"
"A partir de relatos contemporâneos e históricos, parece que o conhecimento astronômico não estava restrito a membros específicos da sociedade Lokono. No entanto, foram os curandeiros em particular - os líderes espirituais do Lokono conhecidos como _semethi_ - que foram obrigados a dominar os vários aspectos do conhecimento estelar e que poderiam ter sido responsáveis por transmitir as tradições orais associadas a eles de uma geração para a outra. outro. De Rodrigo de Navarette, que por volta de 1550 escreveu um dos primeiros relatos de Lokono, aprendemos, por exemplo, que: “velhos e sábios a quem chamam _Cemetu_ se reúnem nas casas projetadas para suas reuniões e (...) as tradições e façanhas de seus ancestrais e grandes homens, e também narram o que esses ancestrais ouviram de seus antepassados; para que assim se lembrem dos eventos mais antigos de seu país e povo. E, da mesma maneira, eles contam ou pregam sobre eventos relacionados aos céus, sol, lua e estrelas. ”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"O _cemetu_ de Navarette, os curandeiros conhecidos no moderno Lokono como _semethi_, largamente abandonaram suas práticas hoje, o que pode ser a razão pela qual a transmissão do conhecimento astronômico foi interrompida. Muitas constelações de Lokono parecem ter sido esquecidas hoje. Nossas fontes são, portanto, frequentemente limitadas a relatos históricos escritos pelos primeiros exploradores e etnógrafos das Guianas, um dos exemplos mais antigos ilustrados abaixo.\n"

"É essa literatura que nos permite reconstruir o conhecimento estelar de Lokono, descrito abaixo. Antes de discutir os corpos celestes individuais, no entanto, várias características gerais da astronomia de Lokono merecem uma menção, a saber:\n"
"\n"
"* a sobreposição com as tradições astronômicas dos grupos indígenas vizinhos.\n"
"* as tradições orais explicando a origem e o significado dos corpos celestes.\n"
"* o uso do termo \"espírito\" em nomes de inúmeras constelações.\n"
"* o uso do termo geral _wiwa_ 'estrela, ano' e a falta de outros termos astronômicos.\n"
"* o céu assistindo práticas do Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Conhecimento compartilhado de Guianan\n"
"\n"
"O território de Lokono faz fronteira com o de dois povos indígenas linguisticamente independentes, os Kari'na, que falam uma língua caribana, e os Warao, que falam uma língua isolada. Embora não relacionados e tradicionalmente não casem, os três grupos compartilham uma grande quantidade de cultura material e imaterial. A tradição etnoastronômica dos três povos também mostra várias semelhanças impressionantes, como mitos estelares compartilhados, nomes semelhantes de constelações e paralelos no calendário estelar. Isso fala dos contatos entre os três grupos e da troca de conhecimento astronômico, possivelmente facilitado por seus respectivos líderes espirituais, como os Lokono Sememi. O grau em que essas tradições se sobrepõem e a direcionalidade de suas trocas exigem um estudo mais aprofundado. Aqui, focamos no Lokono e, portanto, não discutimos esses empréstimos culturais em detalhes, a menos que eles lançem luz sobre a etnoastronomia de Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"2. Tradições orais estelares\n"
"\n"
"Uma dessas características compartilhadas são os mitos sobre as estrelas. Tais tradições orais falam das origens de determinados corpos celestes, vinculam-nos e explicam sua influência no mundo natural. A constelação de Lokono _Hithikoya_ 'Espírito do mutum preto', por exemplo, está ligada no mito de Lokono ao de Yokh'rhin_ 'Hunter' e _Alêti_ 'Torch', todos os três com equivalentes Kari'na e Warao. São essas tradições orais, preservadas pelos curandeiros, que provavelmente serviram como o principal veículo através do qual o conhecimento astronômico foi passado de uma geração para outra. Por esse motivo, resumos dos mitos relevantes são apresentados na descrição de constelações particulares. Ocasionalmente, quando o mito relevante de Lokono não é documentado, os mitos dos grupos vizinhos são mencionados a fim de esclarecer a importância de determinados corpos celestes. Dado que muitas dessas tradições orais são compartilhadas pelos Lokono e pelos grupos vizinhos, justifica-se esse aprimoramento do conhecimento astronômico mal preservado de Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"3. Calendário de bebidas espirituosas\n"
"\n"
"O termo _koya_ 'espírito', encontrado em vários nomes de constelações, geralmente seguindo um termo para uma planta ou animal em particular, é uma característica fundamental da astronomia de Lokono. Walter Roth, etnógrafo das Guianas, explica que essas constelações são os espíritos dos seres correspondentes. [#4] Na época do ano em que a constelação aparece, o espírito viaja do céu para a terra para dar vida aos seres que ela é. representa. Assim, as constelações de koya formaram um calendário, indicando qual o melhor momento para se envolver em atividades de subsistência relacionadas a essas plantas e animais (por exemplo, caça ou coleta). O Lokono também pode saber onde esses espíritos desceriam na terra; Walter Roth sugere que eles chamam esses lugares com os mesmos nomes das constelações, mas a evidência disso permanece fraca. Assim, \"Hadorhikoya\" 'Espírito do acouchi vermelho' se referiria ao espírito, à constelação e ao lugar onde o _hadorhi_ é encontrado em abundância quando sua constelação aparece. Embora esse conhecimento toponímico seja esquecido hoje em dia, as constelações koya lembram o grande entendimento da vida vegetal e animal que os Lokono possuíam.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, a estrela e o ano\n"
"\n"
"Os Lokono também têm outro termo geral que é usado para se referir às estrelas, _wiwa_. O termo carece das conotações espirituais de koya. Refere-se, por um lado, à qualidade física das estrelas como algo brilhante e, por outro, ao ano civil. Como tal, é usado, por exemplo, quando se fala da idade de alguém. Embora possa se aplicar a qualquer estrela, _wiwa_ aparece apenas em dois nomes próprios de corpos celestes. Yôkoro wiwa, literalmente 'Partículas de estrelas' (Plêiades), é a mais importante de todas as constelações de Lokono, cuja aparência tradicionalmente começa no ano civil de Lokono. A seguir a Yôkoro wiwa estão as numerosas constelações de koya, cada uma sinalizando uma estação diferente no calendário de Lokono. Por outro lado, _Wiwa kalemero_, literalmente 'Estrela Brilhante' (Júpiter), parece ter sido destacado apenas devido ao seu brilho. Além de wiwa e koya, não há termos genéricos que distinguem planetas, estrelas, luas, sóis, galáxias e assim por diante na língua lokono. Por esse motivo, o equivalente Lokono da Via Láctea, por exemplo, está incluído entre outras constelações.\n"
"\n"
"5. Práticas de observação do céu\n"
"\n"
"Enquanto o Lokono pode admirar o céu à noite, para seguir o calendário estelar de Lokono, é preciso observar as constelações por volta das 4 da manhã, hora em que o Lokono geralmente acorda. Os Lokono observam assim o surgimento das constelações pela manhã. Para ter uma idéia correta do ciclo anual de constelações, deve-se também definir o local de visualização para as Guianas (por exemplo, Georgetown, Paramaribo ou Cayenne no menu local). Merece uma menção que muitos Lokono, ao desenhar constelações, não ligavam as estrelas com linhas e que, em alguns casos, havia pouco acordo entre os falantes sobre qual estrela dentro de uma constelação corresponde a quais partes da planta ou animal representa. No Stellarium, representamos constelações com linhas, mas deve-se ter em mente que isso pode ser uma distorção da tradição Lokono, que permite mais flexibilidade na interpretação de grupos estelares específicos. Finalmente, existem restrições quanto à observação de alguns corpos celestes, pois acredita-se que um cônjuge pode prejudicar alguém se for observado [#5]. Por exemplo, na lua cheia, as mães cobriam os olhos dos filhos para que não ficassem doentes [#6]. Os jovens também foram instruídos a não olhar para Yôkoro wiwa (Plêiades), senão eles não cresceriam [#7]. Tais práticas se aplicavam também a outros objetos que, acredita-se, abrigavam espíritos poderosos e incluíam outras maneiras de evitar o contato visual com espíritos como esfregar pimentas, limas ou sal nos olhos.\n"
"\n"
"Corpos celestes Lokono\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"O termo Lokono para o Sol é Hadali, também pronunciado como Adali. Claaudius de Goeje sugere que os nomes escritos de várias maneiras do herói da cultura Lokono, o primeiro curandeiro conhecido como Harlitvanli, Haliwalika, Halwanli, Hararii e Araanili e, às vezes, Araidi, podem às vezes se referir ao mesmo herói identificado como o Sol. ] Embora não possamos confirmar esta hipótese, vale a pena mencionar o mito de _Arawidi_. No mito de Lokono, Araidi, o Sol, é o pai de um homem que se torna a constelação.Mabukuli_ 'Homem sem coxa' (cinto de Orion) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Segundo a história, o Sol costumava vir à Terra na forma de um homem chamado Araidi para encontrar seu amante com quem ele tinha gêmeos. Em um episódio posterior do mito, um dos gêmeos se casa com uma mulher, cuja mãe o casal decide matar. Quando eles tentam escapar, a irmã da esposa os persegue e consegue cortar sua perna em vingança. Como resultado, o homem sobe ao céu e se torna a constelação _Mabukuli_. Outro mito de Lokono alerta para ofender o Sol: um homem, preso em uma ilha desabitada no meio de um pântano, grita por socorro. Um barco passa por ele, mas dentro do barco está o Sol, que não quer ajudar o homem, pois as pessoas sempre reclamam que o Sol brilha demais [#11]. Quanto às práticas relacionadas ao Sol, Im Thurn relatou que, entre os Lokono, o eclipse do Sol era considerado uma guerra entre _Hadali_ e _Kathi_, a Lua, e que o Lokono gritava e fazia todo tipo de barulho para impedi-los de lutando [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"A lua é conhecida como _Kathi_, um termo registrado por Joannes de Laet como _cattehee_ por volta de 1598, e também usado para se referir ao mês lunar [#13]. Segundo o Lokono, a Lua, como o Sol, já foi homem. Walter Roth relata um mito de Lokono, no qual uma jovem mulher era visitada por um amante misterioso noite após noite [#10]. Para descobrir quem era o amante, a mulher esfregou as mãos com a fuligem do fundo de uma panela. No dia seguinte, quando acordou, descobriu que o rosto de seu irmão estava coberto de fuligem e percebeu que era ele quem a visitava à noite. Todos em sua comunidade começaram a evitar o irmão incestuoso, que ficou tão envergonhado que se afastou das pessoas e finalmente ascendeu ao céu, se tornando a lua. É por isso que, de acordo com o Lokono, a face da lua está suja hoje. A lua aparece também em outro mito. No mito de Lokono sobre um homem preso em uma ilha desabitada mencionada acima, outro barco passa pelo homem, mas desta vez é a Lua, que decide ajudar o homem, pois as pessoas sempre ficam felizes em ver a Lua sair à noite [#11]. A Lua e o Sol também são retratados como oponentes. Em épocas anteriores, os Lokono acreditavam que o eclipse da Lua é sua morte (kathi ôdon_ 'moon dying') e vigiavam a noite toda. [#6] Os Lokono dizem durante o eclipse da Lua que a Lua adormeceu. o caminho do sol [#11]. Portanto, eles fazem muito barulho, tocam bateria e tocam trombetas para acordá-lo. Na lua cheia, as mães cobriam os olhos de seus filhos para que não ficassem doentes.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Vênus'\n"
"\n"
"O planeta Vênus, quando aparece de manhã como Estrela da Manhã e quando aparece à noite como Estrela da Noite, é chamado de \"Warhokoma_\" pelo Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15]. Charles Dance, por outro lado, relata os termos _Eweiwah_ e _Huewah_, provavelmente os equivalentes do termo geral _wiwa_\n"
"'Estrela', que pode ser usada para qualquer corpo celeste brilhante [#16]. Os Lokono também falam de Vênus como _Hiyaro com 'estrela das mulheres'. Em relação a isso, merece menção que Claudius de Goeje relata que quando _Hiyaro wiwa_ aparecer perto da Lua e uma garota estiver prestes a ter sua primeira menstruação, os Lokono dizem que a garota logo será tocada pela Lua [#5] Não há mito sobre Warhokoma especificamente e sua relação com a Lua, mas vale lembrar que os Lokono conhecem uma história, na qual a Lua era originalmente um homem que cometeu incesto com sua irmã (veja o mito mencionado em _Kathi_), e tem um nome como mulherengo [#10]. Curiosamente, o nome Warhokoma de Morning or Evening Star também aparece em Kari'na, que também o vê como a esposa da Lua [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Via Láctea'\n"
"\n"
"A Via Láctea é conhecida entre os Lokono como Waya nukuthi bunaha, literalmente\n"
"'Caminho dos portadores de argila'. A Via Láctea representa as pegadas de homens que uma vez foram buscar argila para fazer panelas, uma arte que raramente é praticada hoje pelo Lokono. A origem do nome, no entanto, ainda é conhecida e é resumida em um mito [#19]. O mesmo nome para a Via Láctea foi observado por William Brett, que acrescenta que recebeu o nome de um tipo específico de argila esbranquiçada [#14]. Charles Dance, por outro lado, diz que a Via Láctea representa as pegadas de queixadas enraizando no barro, enquanto Walter Roth menciona uma explicação diferente de Lokono, segundo a qual a Via Láctea representa uma anta perseguida por um cachorro e onça-pintada [#10] [#16]. No entanto, essas duas fontes não dão o nome Lokono correspondente para a Via Láctea, e é possível que essas duas explicações sejam uma influência de Kari'na, que reconhece uma constelação de um tigre após a constelação de uma anta dentro da Via Láctea. Caminho [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"O Lokono moderno chama Sirius de _Mali_, cujo significado literal é desconhecido. Cornelius van Coll descreve uma estrela de Lokono chamada _Mali_ e explica que é uma estrela muito poderosa [#7] [#17]. Quando chega de manhã em agosto, mata o peixe nos pântanos, e não se deve apontar para ele ou o dedo se tornará manco. O _Mali de Cornelius van Coll marca o início da grande estação seca (agosto a dezembro), chamada em Lokono _malidalithe_, um termo derivado de _Mali_. Fontes mais antigas identificaram Mali como Lyra, Áquila ou Crux, mas, como a grande estação seca começa por volta de agosto e os Lokono observam as estrelas pela manhã, essas identificações devem estar incorretas; Lyra, Aquila e Crux não podem ser vistos no momento nos territórios de Lokono [#11] [#17]. Não há mitos de Lokono sobre _Mali_, mas há evidências que podem corresponder à constelação de Kari'na _Ombatapo_\n"
"\"Cara anterior\". Os mitos de Kari'na explicam a origem da constelação e seu nome, que, como o Lokono _Mali_, acredita-se que mata os peixes nos pântanos e anuncia o início da grande estação seca. Além disso, o Kari'na _Ombatapo_ é identificado como parte de Puppis e Canis Major, o último dos quais inclui Sirius [#18] [#20]."

"The constellation _Yorhada_ ‘Grill’, or _Wiwa yorhadale_ ‘Star’s grill’,\n"
"represents a wooden grill, on which meat is roasted [#4][#11][#21]. Its origin\n"
"is explained in a myth related by Walter Roth about a man who killed his wife,\n"
"roasted her, and fed her liver to his mother-in-law because she called him a\n"
"worthless hunter [#10]. In revenge, the mother asked her brother, _Kamodo_ to\n"
"kill the man when he went hunting. The man suspected the woman set a trap and\n"
"escaped death by sending his brother instead. The grill on which the wife was\n"
"roasted became the Western constellation Pegasus, according to contemporary\n"
"Lokono, marking the beginning of the small dry season (April), the time when\n"
"the Lokono roast a lot of fish. The myth is similar to that of _Yôkoro wiwa_\n"
"and the twins, in which the older brother is responsible for roasting his wife\n"
"and may be the same as the man who roasted his wife in the _Yorhada_ myth. In\n"
"both myths, the younger brother killed by the anaconda becomes _Yôkoro wiwa_,\n"
"while the grill becomes _Yorhada_. Claudius de Goeje suggested that _Yorhada_\n"
"is the Western constellation Corvus, but Corvus does not appear at beginning of\n"
"the small dry season [#11]. The neighboring Warao also know Pegasus as the\n"
"grill, and are familiar with the myth [#10]."

"A constelação _Yorhada_ 'Grill', ou _Wiwa yorhadale_ 'Star's grill', "
"representa uma grade de madeira, na qual a carne é assada [#4] [#11] [#21]. "
"Sua origem é explicada em um mito relatado por Walter Roth sobre um homem "
"que matou sua esposa, a assou e deu o fígado à sogra porque ela o chamava de"
" caçador inútil [#10]. Em vingança, a mãe pediu ao irmão, Kamodo, para matar"
" o homem quando ele foi caçar. O homem suspeitou que a mulher montou uma "
"armadilha e escapou da morte enviando seu irmão. A churrasqueira em que a "
"esposa foi assada se tornou a constelação ocidental Pegasus, segundo o "
"contemporâneo Lokono, marcando o início da pequena estação seca (abril), "
"época em que o Lokono assava muitos peixes. O mito é semelhante ao de Yôkoro"
" wiwa e aos gêmeos, nos quais o irmão mais velho é responsável por assar sua"
" esposa e pode ser o mesmo que o homem que assou sua esposa no mito de "
"Yorhada. Nos dois mitos, o irmão mais novo morto pela anaconda se torna "
"Yôkoro wiwa, enquanto a grade se torna Yorhada. Claudius de Goeje sugeriu "
"que Yorhada é a constelação ocidental Corvus, mas Corvus não aparece no "
"início da pequena estação seca [#11]. O vizinho Warao também conhece Pegasus"
" como o grelhador e está familiarizado com o mito [#10]."

"The constellation _Yôkoro wiwa_ or _Wiwa yôkoro_, literally ‘Score of stars’,\n"
"refers to the Pleiades and is easily recognized by the contemporary Lokono.\n"
"This is likely because _Yôkoro wiwa_ is described as the most important of\n"

"After it comes out first in June in the east, it is followed by the numerous\n"

"look at it, or else they will not grow [#7]. These omens and warnings are\n"
"related to a Lokono myth. According to the story, there were once twin\n"
"brothers, one of which had a wife, and said that death would come when their\n"
"star, _Yôkoro Wiwa_, rises [#7]. Death came indeed, killing even his wife,\n"
"roasting her on the fire, and the Lokono became angry and brought a giant green\n"
"anaconda to swallow the twins. The snake ate one of the brothers, but because\n"
"it was already 5 am and the day broke, the snake could not eat the other\n"
"brother. The snake is now the constellation _Kamodokoya_ ‘Spirit of the green\n"
