"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"

"### Lokono天文知識：簡介\n"
"\n"
"從當代和歷史的角度來看，天文學知識似乎並不局限於洛科諾社會的特定成員。但是，特別是需要醫務人員-洛科諾人的精神領袖-被稱為semethi-才需要掌握恆星知識的各個方面，並且可能負責將與他們相關的口頭傳統從一代傳給另一個。從羅德里戈·德·納瓦雷特（Rodrigo de Navarette）（他於1550年左右寫過Lokono的最早記載之一）中，我們得知：“被稱為Cemetu的年長而睿智的人聚集在為他們的會議而設計的房屋中，並重新敘述（……）他們的祖先和偉人的傳統和功績，還敘述了這些祖先從祖先那裡聽到的消息；這樣他們就可以記住自己國家和人民最古老的事件。而且，他們以類似的方式講述或宣講與天堂，太陽，月亮和星星有關的事件。” [#3]\n"
"\n"
"納瓦雷特（Navarette）的cemetu，在現代洛科諾語中被稱為semethi的醫務人員，如今已很大程度上放棄了他們的做法，這可能是天文學知識傳播被中斷的原因。許多Lokono星座今天似乎已被遺忘。因此，我們的資料通常僅限於圭亞那的早期探險家和民族志學家撰寫的歷史記載，下面是其中最古老的例子之一。\n"

"洛科諾（Lokono）領土與兩個在語言上不相關的土著人民接壤，卡里那（Kari’na）講加勒比語，而瓦拉人（Warao）講語言孤立。儘管這三者之間沒有聯繫，而且傳統上不會通婚，但是這三類人共享著許多物質和非物質文化。這三個民族的人文天文學傳統也顯示出許多驚人的相似之處，例如共同的恆星神話，相似的星座名稱以及恆星曆法中的相似之處。這說明了這三個群體之間的聯繫以及天文知識的交流，這可能是由他們各自的精神領袖（例如，Lokono semethi）促進的。這些傳統的重疊程度及其交流的方向性需要進一步研究。在這裡，我們將重點放在Lokono上，因此，除非它們對Lokono民族天文學有所了解，否則我們將不詳細討論這些文化借用。\n"
"\n"
"### 2.口頭傳統\n"
"\n"
"這種共享特徵之一是關於恆星的神話。這種口頭傳統講述了特定天體的起源，將它們彼此聯繫起來，並解釋了它們對自然世界的影響。舉例來說，洛可諾星座Hithikoya的“黑魔咒之靈”與洛卡諾神話中的Yokhârhin“ Hunter”和Alêti“ Torch”的神話聯繫在一起，這三個星座都具有Kari’na和Warao的等價物。醫務人員保留的正是這些口頭傳統，可能是天文學知識從一代傳給另一一代的主要手段。因此，在特定星座的描述中給出了有關神話的摘要。有時，當相關的洛可諾神話沒有記錄在案時，為了說明特定天體的重要性，會提及鄰近群體的神話。鑑於Lokono和附近的團體共享了許多這樣的口頭傳統，因此對保存欠佳的Lokono天文知識的增強是有道理的。\n"
"\n"
"### 3.精神日曆\n"
"\n"
"Lokono天文學的一個關鍵特徵是，在許多星座名稱中通常都出現一個特殊的植物或動物的術語“ koya”（精神）這一術語。圭亞那的民族志學家沃爾特·羅斯（Walter Roth）解釋說，這樣的星座是相應生物的靈魂。[#4]在每年星座出現的時候，這種靈魂從天上飛向地球，將生命呼吸到它所存在的生物中。代表。這樣，高野星座形成了一個日曆，表明從事與這些動植物有關的生計活動（例如狩獵或採集）的最佳時間是什麼。洛科諾人也可能知道這種精神將降落在地球上的什麼地方。沃爾特·羅斯（Walter Roth）建議，他們用與星座相同的名稱來稱呼這些地方，但證據仍然不充分。因此，Hadorhikoya的“紅色阿庫奇酒的精神”指的是酒的精神，星座以及當星座出現時在其身上發現大量的hadorhi的地方。雖然今天已經忘記了這些地名知識，但高野星座使我們想起了對Lokono所擁有的動植物的深刻理解。\n"
"\n"
"### 4. Wiwa，星星和年份\n"
"\n"
"洛科諾（Lokono）也有另一個通用術語，用於指代恆星wiwa。該術語缺乏koya的精神內涵。一方面，它指的是恆星的光亮，另一方面又是日曆年。因此，例如在談論一個人的年齡時使用它。儘管wiwa可以應用於任何恆星，但它僅以兩個天體的專有名稱出現。洛科諾（Yôkorowiwa）字面意思是“星分”（Pleiades），是所有洛科諾星座中最重要的星座，從傳統上來說，其外觀始於洛科諾日曆年。在Yôkorowiwa之後，出現了眾多的科雅星座，每個星座都標誌著Lokono日曆中不同的季節。另一方面，實際上是“發光之星”（木星）的Wiwa kalemero似乎僅由於其亮度而被選出來。除了wiwa和koya外，沒有任何通用術語可以用Lokono語言來區分行星，恆星，衛星，月亮，太陽，星係等。由於這個原因，例如，在其他星座中包括了與銀河系相當的洛科諾。\n"
"\n"
"### 5.觀看天空的習慣\n"
"\n"
"儘管Lokono可以在晚上欣賞天空，但要遵循Lokono恆星日曆，人們必須在早上4點左右（通常是Lokono醒來的時間）看一下這些星座。洛科諾（Lokono）因此在早上觀察到星座的上升。為了正確了解星座的年度週期，還應將查看位置設置為圭亞那（例如，位置菜單中的Georgetown，Paramaribo或Cayenne）。值得一提的是，許多洛科諾人在繪製星座時並沒有將星星與直線連接起來，而且在某些情況下，發言人之間就星座中的哪顆恆星對應於它代表的植物或動物的哪個部分幾乎沒有共識。在恆星中，我們用線條來表示星座，但是要記住，這可能是洛可諾傳統的一種扭曲，它在解釋特定的恆星群方面具有更大的靈活性。最後，在觀看某些天體方面存在限制，因為據信，如果觀看[#5]，則長劍會傷害到一個人。例如，在滿月時，母親遮住了孩子的眼睛，使他們不會生病[#6]。年輕人還被告知不要看“ Piaiades”，否則他們不會長大[#7]。這種做法也適用於其他相信帶有烈性酒的物品，包括避免與烈酒眼神接觸的其他方法，例如在人的眼睛上擦胡椒，酸橙或鹽。\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono天體\n"
"\n"
"哈達利“太陽”\n"
"\n"
"太陽的洛可諾語是Hadali，也稱為Adali。 Claaudius de Goeje建議洛科諾文化英雄的名字拼寫不同，他是第一個被稱為Harlitvanli，Haliwalika，Halwanli，Hariwalli和Arawanili的藥師，有時還包括Arawidi，它們全都指代被稱為太陽的同一英雄[#8]。儘管我們無法證實這一假設，但值得一提的是Arawidi的神話。在洛可諾神話中，太陽的阿拉維迪（Arawidi）是一個男人的父親，這個男人後來成為馬布庫裡星座（沒有大腿的男人）（獵戶座的腰帶）[#9] [#10] [#11]。根據故事，太陽曾經以一個叫阿拉維迪（Arawidi）的男人的身份來到地球上，與他的雙胞胎戀人見面。在神話的後期，一對雙胞胎與一個女人結婚，這對夫婦的母親決定殺死他們。當他們試圖逃脫時，妻子的姐姐追趕他們，並設法報仇切斷了他的腿。結果，該人升上天空，成為馬布庫裡星座。另一個洛可諾神話警告不要冒犯太陽：一名男子被困在沼澤中間一個無人居住的島嶼上，大聲呼救。一艘船經過他，但船內是太陽，它不想幫助這個人，因為人們總是抱怨太陽照得太硬[#11]。就與太陽有關的習俗而言，Im Thurn報告說，在洛科諾河中，日蝕被認為是哈達利與凱蒂，月球之間的戰爭，洛科諾河會大聲喊叫並發出各種聲音以阻止它們從戰鬥[#12]。\n"
"\n"
"凱蒂·穆恩\n"
"\n"
"月亮被稱為凱西（Kathi），約瑟斯·德·萊特（Joannes de Laet）最早在1598年左右將其記錄為cattehee，也用於指農曆月[#13]。根據洛科諾人的說法，月亮就像太陽一樣，曾經是一個人。沃爾特·羅斯（Walter Roth）報導了一個洛科諾神話，一個神秘的情人夜夜拜訪一位年輕女子[#10]。為了找出情人是誰，該名女子從鍋底部用煙灰塗抹了雙手。第二天，當她醒來時，她發現她哥哥的臉被煙灰遮蓋，並意識到是他在晚上拜訪了她。她社區中的每個人都開始避開這個亂倫兄弟，後者變得非常ham愧，以至於他遠離人們，最終升上了天空，變成了月亮。根據Lokono的說法，這就是為什麼今天的月球表面很髒。月亮也出現在另一個神話中。在上述關於一個人被困在一個無人島上的洛可諾神話中，另一艘船經過了那個人，但是這次是月亮，它決定幫助這個人，因為人們總是很高興看到月亮在晚上出來[#11]。月亮和太陽也被描繪成對手。在過去的時間裡，洛科諾人認為月食是它的死亡（kathiôdon'moon dying'），並且會整夜監視。[#6]洛科諾人在月蝕時說，月亮已經入睡了。太陽的路徑[#11]。因此，它們發出很大的聲音，打鼓，吹殼喇叭將他叫醒。到了滿月，母親們才會遮住孩子的眼睛，以免他們生病。\n"
"\n"
"Warhokoma“金星”\n"
"\n"
"金星，既在早晨以晨星的形式出現，又在傍晚以晚星的形式出現，被洛科諾[#8] [#14] [#15]稱為Warhokoma。另一方面，查爾斯·舞蹈（Charles Dance）報告了Eweiwah和Huewah這兩個術語，可能與wiwa的總稱等效。\n"
"可以用於任何閃耀的天體的“星” [#16]。洛科諾人還稱金星為“女星” Hiyaro wiwa。關於這一點，值得一提的是，克勞迪烏斯·德·格耶（Claudius de Goeje）報告說，當希亞羅·維瓦（Hiyaro wiwa）出現在月球附近，而一個女孩即將月經時，洛科諾說，這個女孩很快就會被月球所觸摸[#5]。關於Warhokoma以及它與月球的關係並沒有神話，但值得提醒的是，Lokono知道一個故事，其中月亮最初是與姐姐犯下亂倫的人（參見Kathi提到的神話），以及有一個名叫化名的名字[#10]。有趣的是，早起或晚星的Warhokoma這個名字也出現在卡納娜（Kari’na），後者也將其視為月球的妻子[#17] [#18]。\n"
"\n"
"Waya nukuthi bunaha“銀河系”\n"
"\n"
"銀河系在Lokono中被稱為Waya nukuthi bunaha，字面意思是\n"
"“黏土載體的路徑”。銀河系代表曾經去取粘土做鍋的男人的腳印，這種藝術如今已經很少被Lokono所採用。但是，該名稱的由來仍然是已知的，並且在神話[#19]中進行了概述。威廉·布雷特（William Brett）指出了銀河系的同一個名字，並補充說它以一種特定的發白的粘土命名[#14]。另一方面，查爾斯·舞蹈（Charles Dance）說，銀河系代表了野獸在泥土上紮根的腳印，而沃爾特·羅斯（Walter Roth）則提到了洛科諾河的另一種解釋，根據該解釋，銀河系代表了被狗和美洲虎追逐的tap [#10] [#16]。但是，這兩個來源並沒有為銀河系提供相應的Lokono名稱，這兩種解釋很可能是卡里娜的影響，他們認識到在銀河系中a的星座之後是老虎的星座。方式[#17]。\n"
"\n"
"馬里“天狼星”\n"
"\n"
"現代的Lokono稱為Sirius Mali，其字面意思不明。 Cornelius van Coll描述了一個名為Mali的Lokono恆星，並解釋說這是一顆非常強大的恆星[#7] [#17]。當它在八月的早晨出現時，它殺死了沼澤中的魚，一個人不要指著它，否則一個人的手指會變得la腳。 Cornelius van Coll的馬里標誌著旱季的開始（8月至12月），這個季節的簡稱是Lokono malidalithe，這個詞源於馬里。較早的消息來源初步確定馬里為Lyra，Aquila或Crux，但考慮到旱季始於8月左右，而Lokono則在早晨觀測恆星，因此這些識別肯定是不正確的。目前無法在Lokono領土上看到Lyra，Aquila和Crux [#11] [#17]。沒有關於馬里的洛科諾神話，但是有證據表明這可能與卡里娜星座Ombatapo相符。\n"
"“上一張臉”。卡納娜神話解釋了該星座的起源及其名稱，就像洛科諾馬里一樣，人們認為該星座殺死了沼澤中的魚，並宣布了旱季的開始。此外，卡里娜·翁巴塔波（Kari’na Ombatapo）被認為是Puppis和Canis Major的一部分，後者包括Sirius [#18] [#20]。"
