"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"Los _Lokono_, también conocidos como _Arawak_, son un pueblo indígena de las Guayanas, cuyo territorio se extiende a lo largo de la costa del Océano Atlántico, desde el noroeste de Guyana, a través de Surinam, hasta el noroeste de la Guayana Francesa (ver mapa) [#1]. Los lokono hablan un idioma que pertenece a la familia de lenguas arahuacas, una de las agrupaciones lingüísticas más grandes del continente. Al igual que muchos de sus parientes lingüísticos, los Lokono son agricultores especializados en el cultivo de mandioca (_Manihot esculenta_), que también practican la pesca, la caza y la recolección de plantas silvestres. Sin embargo, como uno de los primeros grupos indígenas que encontraron los europeos en el momento de la conquista, los Lokono han estado en contacto con poblaciones no indígenas durante más de 500 años [#2]. Este contacto se intensificó en el siglo pasado, lo que condujo a una pérdida sustancial del idioma Lokono, material tradicional y cultura inmaterial, cambios en las prácticas de subsistencia y, en particular, a la desaparición de _medicina-hombres_, los portadores tradicionales del conocimiento espiritual, muy probablemente incluyendo el conocimiento etnoastronómico.\n"
"\n"
"Como consecuencia, el conocimiento moderno sobre los cuerpos celestes parece ser solo una fracción de lo que el Lokono sabía sobre las estrellas en el pasado.

"Según relatos contemporáneos e históricos, parece que el conocimiento astronómico no estaba restringido a miembros particulares de la sociedad Lokono.

De Rodrigo de Navarette, quien alrededor de 1550 escribió uno de los primeros relatos del Lokono, aprendemos, por ejemplo, que: \"los hombres viejos y sabios a los que llaman _Cemetu_ se reúnen en las casas diseñadas para sus reuniones y (...) cuentan las tradiciones y hazañas de sus antepasados y grandes hombres, y también narran lo que esos antepasados escucharon de sus antepasados; para que así recuerden los eventos más antiguos de su país y su gente.

"El _cemetu_ de Navarette, los curanderos conocidos en el Lokono moderno como _semethi_, han abandonado en gran medida sus prácticas hoy, lo que puede ser la razón por la cual se ha interrumpido la transmisión del conocimiento astronómico. Muchas constelaciones de Lokono parecen haber sido olvidadas hoy. Por lo tanto, nuestras fuentes a menudo se limitan a relatos históricos escritos por los primeros exploradores y etnógrafos de las Guayanas, uno de los ejemplos más antiguos de los cuales se ilustra a continuación.\n"

"Es esta literatura la que nos permite reconstruir el conocimiento estelar de Lokono, que se describe a continuación. Sin embargo, antes de discutir los cuerpos celestes individuales, varias características generales de la astronomía de Lokono merecen una mención, a saber:\n"
"\n"
"* La superposición con las tradiciones astronómicas de los grupos indígenas vecinos.\n"
"* las tradiciones orales que explican el origen y la importancia de los cuerpos celestes.\n"
"* el uso del término _koya_ ‘espíritu’ en los nombres de numerosas constelaciones.\n"
"* el uso del término general _wiwa_ ‘estrella, año’ y la falta de otros términos astronómicos.\n"
"* Las prácticas de observación del cielo del Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Conocimiento de Guyana compartido\n"
"\n"
"El territorio de Lokono limita con el de dos pueblos indígenas no relacionados lingüísticamente, el Kari’na, que habla un idioma caribe, y el Warao, que habla un idioma aislado. Aunque no están relacionados y tradicionalmente no se casan, los tres grupos comparten una gran cantidad de cultura material e inmaterial. La tradición etnoastronómica de los tres pueblos también muestra una serie de sorprendentes similitudes, como mitos estelares compartidos, nombres similares de constelaciones y paralelos en el calendario estelar. Esto habla de los contactos entre los tres grupos y del intercambio de conocimiento astronómico, posiblemente facilitado por sus respectivos líderes espirituales, como el Lokono _semethi_. El grado en que estas tradiciones se superponen y la direccionalidad de su intercambio requieren más estudio. Aquí, nos centramos en el Lokono y, por lo tanto, no discutimos estos préstamos culturales en detalle, a menos que arrojen luz sobre la etnoastronomía de Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Tradiciones orales estelares\n"
"\n"
"Una de esas características compartidas son los mitos sobre las estrellas. Tales tradiciones orales hablan de los orígenes de cuerpos celestes particulares, los vinculan entre sí y explican su influencia en el mundo natural. La constelación de Lokono _Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, por ejemplo, está vinculada en un mito Lokono a la de _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ y _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, los tres tienen equivalentes de Kari’na y Warao. Son estas tradiciones orales, preservadas por los curanderos, las que probablemente sirvieron como el vehículo principal a través del cual se transmitió el conocimiento astronómico de una generación a otra. Por esta razón, se dan resúmenes de los mitos relevantes en la descripción de constelaciones particulares. Ocasionalmente, cuando no se documenta el mito relevante de Lokono, se hace referencia a los mitos de los grupos vecinos para iluminar la importancia de cuerpos celestes particulares. Dado que muchas de estas tradiciones orales son compartidas por los Lokono y los grupos vecinos, esta mejora del conocimiento astronómico de Lokono mal conservado está justificada.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendario de espíritus\n"
"\n"
"El término _koya_ ‘espíritu’, que se encuentra en numerosos nombres de constelaciones que generalmente siguen un término para una planta o animal en particular, es una característica clave de la astronomía Lokono. Walter Roth, etnógrafo de las Guayanas, explica que tales constelaciones son los espíritus de los seres correspondientes. [#4] En una época del año en que aparece la constelación, el espíritu viaja del cielo a la tierra para dar vida a los seres. representa. Como tal, las constelaciones _koya_ formaron un calendario que indica cuál es el mejor momento para participar en actividades de subsistencia relacionadas con estas plantas y animales (por ejemplo, cazar o recolectar). El Lokono también pudo haber sabido dónde descenderían esos espíritus en la tierra; Walter Roth sugiere que llamaron a estos lugares con los mismos nombres que las constelaciones, pero la evidencia de eso sigue siendo pobre. Por lo tanto, _Hadorhikoya_ \"Espíritu del acouchi rojo\" se referiría al espíritu, la constelación y el lugar donde el _hadorhi_ se encuentra en abundancia cuando aparece su constelación. Si bien este conocimiento toponímico se olvida hoy en día, las constelaciones _koya_ nos recuerdan la gran comprensión de la vida vegetal y animal que poseía el Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, la estrella y el año\n"
"\n"
"Los Lokono también tienen otro término general que se usa para referirse a las estrellas, _wiwa_. El término carece de las connotaciones espirituales de _koya._ Se refiere, por un lado, a la calidad física de las estrellas como algo brillante y, por otro lado, al año calendario. Como tal, se usa, por ejemplo, cuando se habla de la edad de uno. Si bien puede aplicarse a cualquier estrella, _wiwa_ aparece solo en dos nombres propios de cuerpos celestes. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literalmente \"Decenas de estrellas\" (Pléyades), es la más importante de todas las constelaciones de Lokono, cuya aparición tradicionalmente comienza el año calendario Lokono. Después de _Yôkoro wiwa_ están las numerosas constelaciones de _koya_, cada una de las cuales señala una temporada diferente en el calendario Lokono. Por otro lado, _Wiwa kalemero_, literalmente \"Estrella brillante\" (Júpiter) parece haber sido señalado únicamente debido a su brillo. Además de _wiwa_ y _koya_, no hay términos genéricos que distingan planetas, estrellas, lunas, soles, galaxias, etc. en el idioma Lokono. Por esta razón, el equivalente Lokono de la Vía Láctea, por ejemplo, se incluye entre otras constelaciones.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Prácticas de observación del cielo\n"
"\n"
"Mientras que el Lokono puede admirar el cielo por la noche, para seguir el calendario estelar de Lokono, uno tiene que mirar las constelaciones alrededor de las 4 de la mañana, la hora en que el Lokono generalmente se despierta. El Lokono observa así el surgimiento de las constelaciones en la mañana. Para tener una idea correcta del ciclo anual de constelaciones, también se debe establecer la ubicación de visualización en las Guayanas (por ejemplo, Georgetown, Paramaribo o Cayenne en el menú de ubicación). Cabe mencionar que muchos Lokono, al dibujar constelaciones, no conectaban las estrellas con líneas y que, en algunos casos, había poco acuerdo entre los hablantes sobre qué estrella dentro de una constelación corresponde a qué partes de la planta o animal representa. En Stellarium, representamos constelaciones con líneas, pero debe tenerse en cuenta que esto puede ser una distorsión de la tradición Lokono, lo que permite una mayor flexibilidad en la interpretación de grupos de estrellas particulares. Finalmente, existen restricciones para mirar algunos cuerpos celestes, ya que se cree que un spirt puede dañar a uno si se mira [#5]. Por ejemplo, en luna llena, las madres cubrieron los ojos de sus hijos para que no se enfermaran [#6]. A los jóvenes también se les dijo que no miraran a Yôkoro wiwa (Pléyades), o de lo contrario no crecerían [#7]. Dichas prácticas se aplicaron también a otros objetos que se cree que albergan espíritus poderosos e incluyeron otras formas de evitar el contacto visual con espíritus como frotar pimientos, limas o sal en los ojos.\n"
"\n"
"### Cuerpos celestes Lokono\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sol'\n"
"\n"
"El término Lokono para el Sol es _Hadali_, también pronunciado como _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje sugiere que los nombres deletreados del héroe de la cultura Lokono, el primer curandero conocido como _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_, _Hariwalli_ y _Arawanili_, y algunas veces _Arawidi_, pueden referirse al mismo héroe identificado como el Sol [#8] Si bien no podemos confirmar esta hipótesis, vale la pena mencionar el mito de _Arawidi_. En el mito de Lokono, _Arawidi_, el Sol, es el padre de un hombre que se convierte en la constelación _Mabukuli_ \"Hombre sin muslo\" (Cinturón de Orión) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Según la historia, el Sol solía venir a la tierra en la forma de un hombre llamado _Arawidi_ para encontrarse con su amante con quien tenía gemelos. En un episodio posterior del mito, uno de los gemelos se casa con una mujer, cuya madre la pareja decide matar. Cuando intentan escapar, la hermana de la esposa los persigue y logra cortarle la pierna en venganza. Como resultado, el hombre asciende al cielo y se convierte en la constelación de Mabukuli. Otro mito de Lokono advierte contra ofender al Sol: un hombre, atrapado en una isla deshabitada en medio de un pantano, clama por ayuda. Un bote lo pasa, pero dentro del bote está el Sol, que no quiere ayudar al hombre, ya que la gente siempre se queja de que el Sol brilla demasiado [#11]. En cuanto a las prácticas relacionadas con el Sol, Im Thurn informó que entre los Lokono, el eclipse del Sol se consideraba una guerra entre _Hadali_ y _Kathi_, la Luna, y que los Lokono gritarían y harían todo tipo de ruidos para detenerlos. luchando [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Luna'\n"
"\n"
"La luna se conoce como _Kathi_, un término registrado por primera vez por Joannes de Laet como _cattehee_ alrededor de 1598, y se usa también para referirse al mes lunar [#13]. Según el Lokono, la Luna, como el Sol, fue una vez un hombre. Walter Roth informa un mito de Lokono, en el que una joven fue visitada por un misterioso amante noche tras noche [#10]. Para descubrir quién era el amante, la mujer se untó las manos con el hollín del fondo de una olla. Al día siguiente, cuando se despertó, descubrió que la cara de su hermano estaba cubierta de hollín y se dio cuenta de que era él quien la visitaba por la noche. Todos en su comunidad comenzaron a evitar al incestuoso hermano, que se avergonzó tanto que se mantuvo alejado de la gente y finalmente ascendió al cielo, convirtiéndose en la Luna. Es por eso que, según el Lokono, la cara de la luna está sucia hoy. La luna aparece también en otro mito. En el mito de Lokono sobre un hombre atrapado en una isla deshabitada mencionada anteriormente, otro barco pasa al hombre, pero esta vez dentro está la Luna, que decide ayudar al hombre, ya que la gente siempre está feliz de ver salir la Luna por la noche [#11]. La Luna y el Sol también se representan como oponentes. En épocas anteriores, el Lokono creía que el eclipse de la Luna es su muerte (_kathi ôdon_ 'moon dying') y vigilaba toda la noche. [#6] El Lokono dice durante el eclipse de la Luna que la Luna se ha quedado dormida en el camino del sol [#11]. Por lo tanto, hacen mucho ruido, tocan la batería y tocan trompetas para despertarlo. En la luna llena, las madres cubrirían los ojos de sus hijos para que no se enfermen.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"El planeta Venus, tanto cuando aparece en la mañana como la Estrella de la mañana como cuando aparece en la noche como la Estrella de la tarde, es llamado _Warhokoma_ por el Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15]. Charles Dance, por otro lado, informa los términos _Eweiwah_ y _Huewah_, probablemente los equivalentes del término general _wiwa_\n"
"\"Estrella\" que se puede usar para cualquier cuerpo celeste brillante [#16]. Los Lokono también hablan de Venus como _Hiyaro wiwa_ \"estrella de las mujeres\". En relación con esto, vale la pena mencionar que Claudio de Goeje informa que cuando _Hiyaro wiwa_ aparece cerca de la Luna, y una niña está a punto de tener su primera menstruación, el Lokono dice que la niña pronto será tocada por la Luna [#5] No existe un mito sobre _Warhokoma_ específicamente y su relación con la Luna, pero vale la pena recordar que los Lokono conocen una historia, en la que la Luna fue originalmente un hombre que cometió incesto con su hermana (ver el mito mencionado en _Kathi_), y tiene un nombre como mujeriego [#10]. Curiosamente, el nombre _Warhokoma_ para Morning o Evening Star aparece también en Kari’na, quien lo ve también como la esposa de la Luna [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Vía Láctea'\n"
"\n"
"La Vía Láctea es conocida entre los Lokono como _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literalmente\n"
"\"Camino de los portadores de arcilla\". La Vía Láctea representa las huellas de los hombres que una vez fueron a buscar arcilla para hacer ollas, un arte que, rara vez, en absoluto, es practicado por los Lokono en la actualidad. Sin embargo, el origen del nombre aún se conoce y se resume en un mito [#19]. William Brett señaló el mismo nombre para la Vía Láctea, y agrega que lleva el nombre de un tipo específico de arcilla blanquecina [#14]. Charles Dance, por otro lado, dice que la Vía Láctea representa las huellas de los pecaríes enraizados en la arcilla, mientras que Walter Roth menciona una explicación diferente de Lokono, según la cual la Vía Láctea representa un tapir perseguido por un perro y un jaguar [#10] [#16]. Sin embargo, estas dos fuentes no dan el nombre de Lokono correspondiente a la Vía Láctea, y es posible que estas dos explicaciones sean una influencia de Kari'na, que reconocen la constelación de un tigre después de la constelación de un tapir dentro de la de la Vía Láctea. Camino [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"El Lokono moderno llama a Sirius _Mali_, cuyo significado literal es desconocido. Cornelius van Coll describe una estrella Lokono llamada _Mali_ y explica que es una estrella muy poderosa [#7] [#17]. Cuando sale por la mañana en agosto, mata a los peces en los pantanos, y uno no debe señalarlo o el dedo se volverá cojo. _Mali_ de Cornelius van Coll marca el comienzo de la gran estación seca (agosto a diciembre), llamada en Lokono _malidalithe_, un término derivado de _Mali_. Fuentes antiguas identificaron _Mali_ tentativamente como Lyra, Aquila o Crux, pero dado que la gran estación seca comienza alrededor de agosto y que los Lokono observan las estrellas en la mañana, estas identificaciones deben ser incorrectas; Lyra, Aquila y Crux no se pueden ver en este momento desde los territorios Lokono [#11] [#17]. No hay mitos de Lokono sobre _Mali_, pero hay evidencia que puede corresponder a la constelación de Kari'na _Ombatapo_\n"
"\"Cara anterior\". Los mitos de Kari explican el origen de la constelación y su nombre, que, como el Lokono _Mali_, se cree que mata a los peces en los pantanos y anuncia el comienzo de la gran estación seca. Además, el Kari’na _Ombatapo_ se identifica como parte de Puppis y Canis Major, el último de los cuales incluye a Sirius [#18] [#20]."

msgid ""
"The constellation _Hithikoya_ is the ‘Spirit of the black curassow’ (_Crax\n"

"eggs. According to a Lokono myth, _Hithikoya_ lived on earth, but the Lokono\n"
"kept shooting him.[#11] As a result, he ascended to the sky to warn black\n"
"curassows about the approaching hunter (see _Yokhârhin_) and his companion with\n"
"a torch (see _Alêti_). The Lokono identify _Hithikoya_ as the Western\n"

"the higher _Hithikoya_ rises in the morning, the higher the birds climb up the\n"

"The constellation _Yorhada_ ‘Grill’, or _Wiwa yorhadale_ ‘Star’s grill’,\n"
