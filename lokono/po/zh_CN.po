"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"

"### Lokono天文知识：简介\n"
"\n"
"从当代和历史的角度来看，天文学知识似乎并不局限于洛科诺社会的特定成员。但是，特别是需要医务人员-洛科诺人的精神领袖-被称为semethi-才需要掌握恒星知识的各个方面，并且可能负责将与他们相关的口头传统从一代传给另一个。从罗德里戈·德·纳瓦雷特（Rodrigo de Navarette）（他在1550年左右写了《洛科诺》的最早记载之一）中，我们获悉：“被他们称为Cemetu的年长而睿智的人聚集在为开会而设计的房屋中，并重新叙述（……）他们的祖先和伟人的传统和功绩，还叙述了这些祖先从祖先那里听到的消息；这样他们就可以记住自己国家和人民最古老的事件。而且，他们以类似的方式讲述或宣讲与天堂，太阳，月亮和星星有关的事件。” [#3]\n"
"\n"
"纳瓦雷特（Navarette）的cemetu，在现代洛科诺语中被称为semethi的医务人员，如今已很大程度上放弃了他们的作法，这可能是天文学知识传播被中断的原因。许多Lokono星座今天似乎已被遗忘。因此，我们的资料通常仅限于圭亚那的早期探险家和民族志学家撰写的历史记载，下面是其中最古老的例子之一。\n"

"洛科诺（Lokono）领土与两个在语言上不相关的土著人民接壤，卡里那（Kari’na）说加勒比语，而瓦拉人（Warao）讲语言孤立。尽管这三者之间没有联系，而且传统上不会通婚，但是这三类人共享着许多物质和非物质文化。这三个民族的人文天文学传统也显示出许多惊人的相似之处，例如共同的恒星神话，相似的星座名称以及恒星历法中的相似之处。这说明了这三个团体之间的联系以及天文知识的交流，这可能是由他们各自的精神领袖（例如Lokono semethi）促进的。这些传统的重叠程度及其交流的方向性需要进一步研究。在这里，我们将重点放在Lokono上，因此，除非它们对Lokono民族天文学有所了解，否则我们将不详细讨论这些文化借用。\n"
"\n"
"### 2.口头传统\n"
"\n"
"这种共享特征之一是关于恒星的神话。这种口头传统讲述了特定天体的起源，将它们彼此联系起来，并解释了它们对自然世界的影响。举例来说，洛可诺星座Hithikoya的“黑魔咒之灵”与洛可诺神话中的Yokhârhin“ Hunter”和Alêti“ Torch”有关，这三者都具有Kari’na和Warao的等价物。医务人员保留的正是这些口头传统，可能是天文学知识从一代传给另一一代的主要手段。因此，在特定星座的描述中给出了有关神话的摘要。有时，当相关的洛可诺神话没有记录在案时，为了说明特定天体的重要性，会提及邻近群体的神话。鉴于Lokono和附近的团体共享了许多这样的口头传统，因此对保存欠佳的Lokono天文知识的增强是有道理的。\n"
"\n"
"### 3.精神日历\n"
"\n"
"洛迦诺天文学的一个重要特征是，在许多星座名称中通常都带有特定植物或动物的名字，因此出现了“ koya”（精神）一词。圭亚那的民族志学家沃尔特·罗斯（Walter Roth）解释说，这样的星座是相应生物的灵魂。[#4]在每年星座出现的时候，这种灵魂从天上飞向地球，将生命呼吸到它所存在的生物中。代表。这样，高野星座形成了一个日历，表明从事与这些动植物有关的生计活动（例如狩猎或采集）的最佳时间是什么。洛科诺人也可能知道这种精神将降落在地球上的什么地方。沃尔特·罗斯（Walter Roth）建议，他们用与星座相同的名称来称呼这些地方，但证据仍然不充分。因此，Hadorhikoya的“红色阿库奇酒的精神”指的是酒的精神，星座以及当星座出现时在其身上发现大量的hadorhi的地方。虽然今天已经忘记了这些地名知识，但高野星座使我们想起了洛科诺拥有的动植物知识。\n"
"\n"
"### 4. Wiwa，星星和年份\n"
"\n"
"洛科诺（Lokono）也有另一个通用术语，用于指代恒星wiwa。该术语缺乏koya的精神内涵。一方面，它指的是恒星的光亮，另一方面又是日历年。因此，例如在谈论一个人的年龄时使用它。尽管wiwa可以应用于任何恒星，但它仅以两个天体的专有名称出现。洛科诺（Yôkorowiwa）字面意思是“星分”（Pleiades），是所有洛科诺星座中最重要的星座，从传统上来说，其外观始于洛科诺日历年。在Yôkorowiwa之后，出现了众多的科雅星座，每个星座都标志着Lokono日历中不同的季节。另一方面，实际上是“发光之星”（木星）的Wiwa kalemero似乎仅由于其亮度而被选出来。除了wiwa和koya外，没有任何通用术语可以用Lokono语言来区分行星，恒星，卫星，月亮，太阳，星系等。由于这个原因，例如，在其他星座中包括了与银河系相当的洛科诺。\n"
"\n"
"### 5.观看天空的习惯\n"
"\n"
"尽管Lokono可以在晚上欣赏天空，但要遵循Lokono恒星日历，人们必须在早晨4点左右（通常是Lokono醒来的时间）看一下这些星座。洛科诺（Lokono）因此在早上观察到星座的上升。为了正确了解星座的年度周期，还应将查看位置设置为圭亚那（例如，位置菜单中的Georgetown，Paramaribo或Cayenne）。值得一提的是，许多洛科诺人在绘制星座时并没有将星星与直线连接起来，而且在某些情况下，发言人之间就星座中的哪颗恒星对应于它代表的植物或动物的哪个部分几乎没有共识。在恒星中，我们用线条来表示星座，但是要记住，这可能是洛可诺传统的一种扭曲，它在解释特定的恒星群方面具有更大的灵活性。最后，在观看某些天体方面存在限制，因为据信，如果观看[#5]，则长剑会伤害到一个人。例如，在满月时，母亲遮住了孩子的眼睛，使他们不会生病[#6]。年轻人还被告知不要看“ Piaiades”，否则他们不会长大[#7]。这种做法也适用于其他相信带有烈性酒的物品，包括避免与烈性酒发生眼神接触的其他方式，例如在人的眼睛上擦胡椒，酸橙或盐。\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono天体\n"
"\n"
"哈达利“太阳”\n"
"\n"
"太阳的洛可诺语是Hadali，也称为Adali。 Claaudius de Goeje建议洛科诺文化英雄的名字拼写不同，他是第一个被称为Harlitvanli，Haliwalika，Halwanli，Hariwalli和Arawanili的药师，有时还包括Arawidi，它们全都指代被称为太阳的同一英雄[#8]。尽管我们无法证实这一假设，但值得一提的是Arawidi的神话。在洛可诺神话中，太阳的Arawidi是一个人的父亲，这个人成为Mabukuli星座“无大腿的男人”（猎户座的腰带）[#9] [#10] [#11]。根据故事，太阳曾经以一个叫阿拉维迪（Arawidi）的男人的身份来到地球上，与他的双胞胎恋人见面。在神话的后期，一对双胞胎与一个女人结婚，这对夫妇的母亲决定杀死他们。当他们试图逃脱时，妻子的姐姐追赶他们，并设法报仇切断了他的腿。结果，该人升上天空，成为马布库里星座。另一个洛可诺神话警告不要冒犯太阳：一名男子被困在沼泽中间一个无人居住的岛屿上，大声呼救。一艘船经过他，但船内是太阳，它不想帮助这个人，因为人们总是抱怨太阳照得太硬[#11]。就与太阳有关的习俗而言，Im Thurn报告说，在洛科诺河中，日蚀被认为是哈达利与凯蒂，月球之间的战争，洛科诺河会大声喊叫并发出各种声音以阻止它们从战斗[#12]。\n"
"\n"
"凯蒂·穆恩\n"
"\n"
"月亮被称为凯西（Kathi），约瑟斯·德·莱特（Joannes de Laet）最早在1598年左右将其记录为cattehee，也用于指农历月[#13]。根据洛科诺人的说法，月亮就像太阳一样，曾经是一个人。沃尔特·罗斯（Walter Roth）报道了一个洛科诺神话，一个神秘的情人夜夜拜访一位年轻女子[#10]。为了找出情人是谁，该名女子从锅底部用烟灰涂抹了双手。第二天，当她醒来时，她发现她哥哥的脸被烟灰遮盖，并意识到是他在晚上拜访了她。她社区中的每个人都开始避开这个乱伦兄弟，后者变得非常ham愧，以至于他远离人们，最终升上了天空，变成了月亮。根据Lokono的说法，这就是为什么今天的月球表面很脏。月亮也出现在另一个神话中。在上述关于一个人被困在一个无人岛上的洛可诺神话中，另一艘船经过了那个人，但是这次是月亮，它决定帮助这个人，因为人们总是很高兴看到月亮在晚上出来[#11]。月亮和太阳也被描绘成对手。在过去的时间里，洛科诺人认为月食是它的死亡（kathiôdon'moon dying'），并且会整夜监视。[#6]洛科诺人在月蚀时说，月亮已经睡着了太阳的路径[#11]。因此，它们发出很大的声音，打鼓，吹壳喇叭将他叫醒。到了满月，母亲们才会遮住孩子的眼睛，以免他们生病。\n"
"\n"
"Warhokoma“金星”\n"
"\n"
"金星，既在早晨以晨星的形式出现，又在傍晚以晚星的形式出现，被洛科诺[#8] [#14] [#15]称为Warhokoma。另一方面，查尔斯·舞蹈（Charles Dance）报告了Eweiwah和Huewah这两个术语，可能与wiwa的总称等效。\n"
"可以用于任何闪耀的天体的“星” [#16]。洛科诺人还称金星为“女星” Hiyaro wiwa。关于这一点，值得一提的是，克劳迪乌斯·德·格耶（Claudius de Goeje）报告说，当希亚罗·维瓦（Hiyaro wiwa）出现在月球附近，而一个女孩即将月经时，洛科诺说，这个女孩很快就会被月球所触摸[#5]。关于Warhokoma以及它与月球的关系并没有神话，但值得提醒的是，Lokono知道一个故事，其中月亮最初是与姐姐犯下乱伦的人（参见Kathi提到的神话），以及有一个名叫化名的名字[#10]。有趣的是，早起或晚星的Warhokoma这个名字也出现在卡纳娜（Kari’na）中，后者也将其视为月球的妻子[#17] [#18]。\n"
"\n"
"Waya nukuthi bunaha“银河系”\n"
"\n"
"银河系在Lokono中被称为Waya nukuthi bunaha，字面意思是\n"
"“黏土载体的路径”。银河系代表曾经去取粘土做锅的男人的脚印，这种艺术如今已经很少被Lokono所采用。但是，该名称的由来仍然是已知的，并且在神话[#19]中进行了概述。威廉·布雷特（William Brett）指出了银河系的同一个名字，并补充说它以一种特定的发白的粘土命名[#14]。另一方面，查尔斯·舞蹈（Charles Dance）说，银河系代表了野兽在泥土上扎根的脚印，而沃尔特·罗斯（Walter Roth）则提到了洛科诺河的另一种解释，根据该解释，银河系代表了被狗和美洲虎追逐的tap [#10] [#16]。但是，这两个来源并没有为银河系提供相应的Lokono名称，这两种解释很可能是卡里娜的影响，他们在银河系中的a构象之后认识到了老虎的构筑。方式[#17]。\n"
"\n"
"马里“天狼星”\n"
"\n"
"现代的Lokono称为Sirius Mali，其字面意思不明。 Cornelius van Coll描述了一个名为Mali的Lokono恒星，并解释说这是一颗非常强大的恒星[#7] [#17]。当它在八月的早晨出现时，它杀死了沼泽中的鱼，一个人不要指着它，否则一个人的手指会变得la脚。 Cornelius van Coll的马里标志着旱季的开始（8月至12月），这个季节的简称是Lokono malidalithe，这个词源于马里。较早的消息来源初步确定马里为Lyra，Aquila或Crux，但考虑到旱季始于8月左右，而Lokono则在早晨观测恒星，因此这些识别肯定是不正确的。目前无法在Lokono领土上看到Lyra，Aquila和Crux [#11] [#17]。没有关于马里的洛科诺神话，但是有证据表明这可能与卡里娜星座Ombatapo相符。\n"
"“上一张脸”。卡纳娜神话解释了该星座的起源及其名称，就像洛科诺马里一样，人们认为该星座杀死了沼泽中的鱼，并宣布了旱季的开始。此外，卡里娜·翁巴塔波（Kari’na Ombatapo）被确定为Puppis和Canis Major的一部分，后者包括Sirius [#18] [#20]。"
