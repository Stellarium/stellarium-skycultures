"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"Il _Lokono_, noto anche come _Arawak_, è un popolo indigeno della Guiana, il cui territorio si estende lungo la costa dell'Oceano Atlantico, dalla Guyana nordoccidentale, attraverso il Suriname, alla Guyana francese nordoccidentale (vedi mappa) [#1]. I Lokono parlano una lingua che appartiene alla famiglia delle lingue Arawakan, uno dei più grandi gruppi linguistici del continente. Come molti dei loro parenti linguistici, i Lokono sono agricoltori specializzati nell'allevamento della manioca (_Manihot esculenta_), che praticano anche la pesca, la caccia e la raccolta di piante selvatiche. Tuttavia, come uno dei primi gruppi indigeni incontrati dagli europei al momento della conquista, i Lokono sono stati in contatto con popolazioni non indigene per oltre 500 anni [#2]. Questo contatto si è intensificato nel secolo scorso, portando a una sostanziale perdita della lingua Lokono, materiale tradizionale e cultura immateriale, cambiamenti nelle pratiche di sussistenza, e in particolare alla scomparsa di _medicine-men_, i tradizionali portatori di conoscenza spirituale, molto probabilmente compresa la conoscenza etnoastronomica.\n"
"\n"
"Di conseguenza, la conoscenza moderna dei corpi celesti sembra essere solo una frazione di ciò che il Lokono sapeva delle stelle in passato. Diverse costellazioni menzionate nelle fonti più antiche sono state dimenticate o sono conosciute solo dai loro nomi, mentre le combinazioni di stelle che rappresentano e le tradizioni orali che spiegano la loro origine e significato sono state dimenticate.

"Conoscenza astronomica di Lokono: un'introduzione\n"
"\n"
"Da resoconti contemporanei e storici, sembra che la conoscenza astronomica non fosse limitata a particolari membri della società Lokono. Tuttavia, erano in particolare gli uomini-medicina - i leader spirituali del Lokono conosciuti come _semethi_ - che dovevano padroneggiare i vari aspetti della conoscenza delle stelle e che avrebbero potuto essere responsabili del passaggio delle tradizioni orali ad essi associate da una generazione a un altro. Da Rodrigo de Navarette, che intorno al 1550 scrisse uno dei primi racconti del Lokono, apprendiamo, ad esempio, che: “uomini anziani e saggi che chiamano _Cemetu_ si riuniscono nelle case progettate per i loro incontri e (...) raccontano le tradizioni e le imprese dei loro antenati e dei loro grandi uomini, e narrano anche ciò che quegli antenati udirono dai loro antenati; cosicché in questo modo ricordino gli eventi più antichi del loro paese e della loro gente. E, allo stesso modo, raccontano o predicano sugli eventi relativi al cielo, al sole, alla luna e alle stelle. ”[#3]\n"

"Il _cemetu_ di Navarette, gli uomini-medicina conosciuti nel moderno Lokono come _semethi_, hanno ampiamente rinunciato alle loro pratiche oggi, che potrebbe essere il motivo per cui la trasmissione della conoscenza astronomica è stata interrotta. Molte costellazioni di Lokono sembrano essere state dimenticate oggi. Le nostre fonti sono quindi spesso limitate ai resoconti storici scritti dai primi esploratori ed etnografi delle Guiane, uno dei più antichi esempi dei quali è illustrato di seguito.\n"

"È questa letteratura che ci consente di festeggiare la ricostruzione della conoscenza stellare di Lokono, descritta di seguito. Prima di discutere i singoli corpi celesti, tuttavia, meritano una menzione alcune caratteristiche generali dell'astronomia di Lokono:\n"
"\n"
"* la sovrapposizione con le tradizioni astronomiche dei gruppi indigeni vicini.\n"
"* le tradizioni orali che spiegano l'origine e il significato dei corpi celesti.\n"
"* l'uso del termine _koya_ \"spirito\" nei nomi di numerose costellazioni.\n"
"* l'uso del termine generale _wiwa_ \"stella, anno\" e la mancanza di altri termini astronomici.\n"
"* le pratiche di osservazione del cielo del Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Conoscenza della Guianan condivisa\n"
"\n"
"Il territorio di Lokono confina con quello di due popoli indigeni linguisticamente indipendenti, il Kari’na, che parla una lingua caribana, e il Warao, che parla un linguaggio isolato. Sebbene non collegati e tradizionalmente non coniugati, i tre gruppi condividono una grande quantità di cultura materiale e immateriale. La tradizione etnoastronomica dei tre popoli mostra anche una serie di sorprendenti somiglianze, come miti stellari condivisi, nomi simili di costellazioni e parallelismi nel calendario stellare. Ciò parla dei contatti tra i tre gruppi e dello scambio di conoscenze astronomiche, eventualmente facilitate dai rispettivi leader spirituali, come il Lokono _semethi_. Il grado in cui queste tradizioni si sovrappongono e la direzionalità del loro scambio richiedono ulteriori studi. Qui, ci concentriamo sul Lokono e quindi non discutiamo in dettaglio questi prestiti culturali, a meno che non facciano luce sull'etnoastronomia di Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Tradizioni orali stellari\n"
"\n"
"Una di queste caratteristiche condivise sono i miti sulle stelle. Tali tradizioni orali raccontano le origini di particolari corpi celesti, li collegano tra loro e spiegano la loro influenza sul mondo naturale. La costellazione di Lokono _Hithikoya_ \"Spirito del curassow nero\", per esempio, è collegata in un mito di Lokono a quella di _Yokhârhin_ \"Hunter\" e _Alêti_ \"Torch\", tutti e tre i quali hanno equivalenti di Kari'na e Warao. Sono queste tradizioni orali, conservate dagli uomini-medicina, che probabilmente sono servite da veicolo principale attraverso il quale la conoscenza astronomica è stata trasmessa da una generazione all'altra. Per questo motivo, i riassunti dei miti rilevanti sono riportati nella descrizione di particolari costellazioni. Occasionalmente, quando il mito di Lokono in questione non è documentato, si fa riferimento ai miti dei gruppi vicini per illuminare il significato di particolari corpi celesti. Dato che molte di queste tradizioni orali sono condivise dal Lokono e dai gruppi vicini, questo potenziamento della conoscenza astronomica Lokono mal conservata è giustificato.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendario degli spiriti\n"
"\n"
"Il termine _koya_ \"spirito\", che si trova in numerosi nomi di costellazioni che in genere seguono un termine per una particolare pianta o animale, è una caratteristica chiave dell'astronomia di Lokono. Walter Roth, un etnografo delle Guianas, spiega che tali costellazioni sono gli spiriti degli esseri corrispondenti. [#4] In un momento dell'anno in cui appare la costellazione, lo spirito viaggia dal cielo sulla terra per respirare la vita negli esseri rappresenta. Come tale, le costellazioni di _koya_ formavano un calendario, indicando quale era il momento migliore per impegnarsi in attività di sussistenza relative a queste piante e animali (ad esempio caccia o raccolta). Il Lokono potrebbe anche sapere dove tali spiriti discenderebbero sulla terra; Walter Roth suggerisce che hanno chiamato questi posti con gli stessi nomi delle costellazioni ma le prove di ciò rimangono scarse. Pertanto, _Hadorhikoya_ \"Spirito degli acouchi rossi\" si riferirebbe allo spirito, alla costellazione e al luogo in cui si trova l'abbondanza di _hadorhi_ quando appare la sua costellazione. Mentre questa conoscenza toponimica è oggi dimenticata, le costellazioni di _koya_ ci ricordano la grande comprensione della vita vegetale e animale che il Lokono possedeva.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, la stella e l'anno\n"
"\n"
"Il Lokono ha anche un altro termine generale usato per riferirsi alle stelle, _wiwa_. Il termine non ha le connotazioni spirituali di _koya._ Si riferisce, da un lato, alla qualità fisica delle stelle come qualcosa di brillante e, dall'altro, all'anno solare. Come tale, viene utilizzato, ad esempio, quando si parla della propria età. Mentre può applicarsi a qualsiasi stella, _wiwa_ appare solo in due nomi propri di corpi celesti. _Yôkoro wiwa_, letteralmente \"Punteggi di stelle\" (Pleiadi), è la più importante di tutte le costellazioni di Lokono, il cui aspetto inizia tradizionalmente nell'anno solare di Lokono. A seguire _Yôkoro wiwa_ ci sono le numerose costellazioni _koya_, ognuna delle quali segna una stagione diversa nel calendario Lokono. D'altra parte, _Wiwa kalemero_, letteralmente \"Shining star\" (Giove) sembra essere stato scelto solo per la sua luminosità. A parte _wiwa_ e _koya_, non ci sono termini generici che distinguono pianeti, stelle, lune, soli, galassie e così via nella lingua Lokono. Per questo motivo, l'equivalente Lokono della Via Lattea, per esempio, è incluso tra le altre costellazioni.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Pratiche di osservazione del cielo\n"
"\n"
"Mentre il Lokono può ammirare il cielo di sera, per seguire il calendario stellare di Lokono, bisogna guardare le costellazioni intorno alle 4 del mattino, il momento in cui il Lokono si sveglia di solito. Il Lokono osserva così il sorgere delle costellazioni al mattino. Per avere la giusta idea del ciclo annuale delle costellazioni, si dovrebbe anche impostare la posizione di visualizzazione sulle Guianas (ad esempio Georgetown, Paramaribo o Cayenne nel menu della posizione). Merita una menzione del fatto che molti Lokono, quando disegnavano costellazioni, non collegavano le stelle con linee e che in alcuni casi c'era poco accordo tra gli oratori su quale stella all'interno di una costellazione corrispondesse a quali parti della pianta o animale rappresentasse. In Stellarium, rappresentiamo costellazioni con linee, ma va tenuto presente che questa può essere una distorsione della tradizione Lokono, che consente una maggiore flessibilità nell'interpretazione di particolari gruppi di stelle. Infine, ci sono restrizioni sull'osservazione di alcuni corpi celesti, poiché si ritiene che uno spirt possa danneggiare qualcuno se guardato [#5]. Ad esempio, con la luna piena, le madri coprivano gli occhi dei loro bambini in modo che non si ammalassero [#6]. Ai giovani è stato anche detto di non guardare _Yôkoro wiwa_ (Pleiades), altrimenti non sarebbero cresciuti [#7]. Tali pratiche si applicavano anche ad altri oggetti ritenuti in grado di ospitare potenti spiriti e includevano altri modi per evitare il contatto visivo con gli spiriti come strofinare peperoni, lime o sale negli occhi.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono corpi celesti\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"Il termine Lokono per il Sole è _Hadali_, pronunciato anche come _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje suggerisce che i nomi variamente scritti dell'eroe della cultura Lokono, il primo uomo di medicina noto come _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_, _Hariwalli_ e _Arawanili_, e talvolta _Arawidi_, potrebbero tutti riferirsi allo stesso eroe identificato come il Sole [#8]. Sebbene non possiamo confermare questa ipotesi, vale la pena menzionare il mito di _Arawidi_. Nel mito di Lokono, _Arawidi_, il Sole, è il padre di un uomo che diventa la costellazione di _Mabukuli_ \"Uomo senza coscia\" (Cintura di Orione) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Secondo la storia, il Sole veniva sulla terra nella forma di un uomo chiamato _Arawidi_ per incontrare il suo amante con cui aveva due gemelli. In un episodio successivo del mito, una delle gemelle sposa una donna, la cui madre la coppia decide di uccidere. Quando provano a fuggire, la sorella della moglie li insegue e riesce a tagliarsi una gamba per vendetta. Di conseguenza, l'uomo sale verso il cielo e diventa la costellazione _Mabukuli_. Un altro mito di Lokono mette in guardia dall'offendere il Sole: un uomo, bloccato su un'isola disabitata nel mezzo di una palude, chiede aiuto. Una barca lo attraversa, ma all'interno della barca c'è il Sole, che non vuole aiutare l'uomo, poiché le persone si lamentano sempre che il Sole splende troppo forte [#11]. Per quanto riguarda le pratiche legate al Sole, Im Thurn riferì che tra i Lokono, l'eclissi del Sole era considerata una guerra tra _Hadali_ e _Kathi_, la Luna, e che il Lokono avrebbe urlato e fatto tutti i tipi di rumori per impedirgli di combattimento [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Luna'\n"
"\n"
"La luna è conosciuta come _Kathi_, un termine registrato per la prima volta da Joannes de Laet come _cattehee_ intorno al 1598, e usato anche per riferirsi al mese lunare [#13]. Secondo il Lokono, la Luna, come il Sole, un tempo era un uomo. Walter Roth racconta un mito di Lokono, in cui una giovane donna veniva visitata da un misterioso amante notte dopo notte [#10]. Per scoprire chi fosse l'amante, la donna si imbrattò le mani con la fuliggine dal fondo di una pentola. Il giorno dopo, quando si svegliò, scoprì che la faccia di suo fratello era coperta di fuliggine e si rese conto che era stato lui a visitarla di notte. Tutti nella sua comunità iniziarono a evitare il fratello incestuoso, che si vergognava così tanto da tenersi lontano dalla gente e alla fine ascese al cielo, diventando la Luna. Ecco perché, secondo il Lokono, oggi la faccia della luna è sporca. La luna appare anche in un altro mito. Nel mito di Lokono su un uomo bloccato su un'isola disabitata di cui sopra, un'altra barca passa accanto all'uomo, ma questa volta al suo interno c'è la Luna, che decide di aiutare l'uomo, poiché le persone sono sempre felici di vedere la Luna uscire di notte [#11]. La Luna e il Sole sono anche raffigurati come avversari. Nei tempi precedenti, il Lokono credeva che l'eclissi della Luna fosse la sua morte (_kathi ôdon_ 'moon dying') e avrebbe continuato a vegliare tutta la notte. [#6] Il Lokono dice durante l'eclissi della Luna che la Luna si è addormentata il percorso del sole [#11]. Pertanto, fanno molto rumore, suonano la batteria e suonano le trombe di conchiglie per svegliarlo. Alla luna piena, le madri coprivano gli occhi dei loro bambini in modo che non si ammalassero.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"Il pianeta Venere, sia quando appare al mattino come Stella del mattino che quando appare alla sera come Stella della sera, è chiamato _Warhokoma_ dal Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15]. Charles Dance, d'altra parte, riporta i termini _Eweiwah_ e _Huewah_, probabilmente gli equivalenti del termine generale _wiwa_\n"
"\"Stella\" che può essere utilizzata per qualsiasi corpo celeste splendente [#16]. Il Lokono parla anche di Venere come _Hiyaro wiwa_ \"stella delle donne\". In relazione a questo, merita una menzione che Claudius de Goeje riferisce che quando _Hiyaro wiwa_ appare vicino alla Luna e una ragazza sta per avere le sue prime mestruazioni, il Lokono dice che la ragazza sarà presto toccata dalla Luna [#5]. Non esiste alcun mito su _Warhokoma_ in particolare e sulla sua relazione con la Luna, ma vale la pena ricordare che il Lokono conosce una storia, in cui la Luna era in origine un uomo che commise un incesto con sua sorella (vedi il mito menzionato sotto _Kathi_), e ha un nome come donnaiolo [#10]. È interessante notare che il nome _Warhokoma_ per Morning o Evening Star appare anche in Kari’na, che lo vede anche come la moglie della Luna [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Via Lattea'\n"
"\n"
"La Via Lattea è conosciuta tra i Lokono come _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, letteralmente\n"
"\"Percorso dei portatori di argilla\". La Via Lattea rappresenta le impronte degli uomini che una volta andavano a prendere l'argilla per fare vasi, un'arte che, raramente, viene praticata dal Lokono oggi. L'origine del nome, tuttavia, è ancora nota ed è riassunta in un mito [#19]. Lo stesso nome per la Via Lattea è stato notato da William Brett che aggiunge che prende il nome da un tipo specifico di argilla biancastra [#14]. Charles Dance, d'altra parte, afferma che la Via Lattea rappresenta le impronte dei pecari che radicano l'argilla, mentre Walter Roth menziona una diversa spiegazione di Lokono, secondo la quale la Via Lattea rappresenta un tapiro inseguito da un cane e un giaguaro [#10] [#16]. Tuttavia, queste due fonti non danno il nome Lokono corrispondente per la Via Lattea, ed è possibile che queste due spiegazioni siano un'influenza di Kari'na, che riconoscono una costellazione di una tigre che segue la costellazione di un tapiro all'interno di quella della Lattea Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"Il moderno Lokono chiama Sirius _Mali_, il cui significato letterale è sconosciuto. Cornelius van Coll descrive una stella Lokono chiamata _Mali_ e spiega che è una stella molto potente [#7] [#17]. Quando arriva la mattina di agosto, uccide il pesce nelle paludi e non si deve puntare su di esso o il dito diventerà zoppo. Il _Mali_ di Cornelius van Coll segna l'inizio della grande stagione secca (da agosto a dicembre), chiamato in Lokono _malidalithe_, un termine derivato da _Mali_. Fonti precedenti hanno identificato _Mali_ provvisoriamente come Lyra, Aquila o Crux, ma dato che la grande stagione secca inizia intorno ad agosto e che il Lokono osserva le stelle al mattino, queste identificazioni devono essere errate; Lyra, Aquila e Crux non possono essere visti in questo momento dai territori di Lokono [#11] [#17]. Non ci sono miti di Lokono su _Mali_, ma ci sono prove che potrebbero corrispondere alla costellazione di Kari’na _Ombatapo_\n"
"\"Faccia precedente\". I miti di Kari’na spiegano l'origine della costellazione e il suo nome, che, come il Lokono _Mali_, si crede che uccida il pesce nelle paludi e annuncia l'inizio della grande stagione secca. Inoltre, il Kari’na _Ombatapo_ è identificato come parti di Puppis e Canis Major, quest'ultima delle quali include Sirius [#18] [#20]."

"The constellation _Hithikoya_ is the ‘Spirit of the black curassow’ (_Crax\n"
