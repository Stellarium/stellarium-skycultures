"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"### Lokono (of Arawak)\n"
"\n"
"![](lokono_map_1.webp)\n"
"\n"
"De _Lokono_, ook wel bekend als _Arawak_, is een inheems volk van de Guianas, wiens grondgebied zich uitstrekt langs de kust van de Atlantische Oceaan, van het noordwesten van Guyana, via Suriname tot het noordwesten van Frans-Guyana (zie kaart) [#1]. De Lokono spreken een taal die behoort tot de Arawakan-taalfamilie, een van de grootste taalgroepen op het continent. Zoals veel van hun taalkundige verwanten, zijn de Lokono landbouwkundigen die gespecialiseerd zijn in het kweken van maniok (_Manihot esculenta_), die ook vissen, jagen en het verzamelen van wilde planten beoefenen. Als een van de eerste inheemse groepen die de Europeanen bij de verovering tegenkwamen, hebben de Lokono echter al meer dan 500 jaar contact met niet-inheemse bevolkingsgroepen [#2]. Dit contact is in de afgelopen eeuw geïntensiveerd, wat heeft geleid tot een aanzienlijk verlies van de Lokono-taal, traditionele materiële en immateriële cultuur, veranderingen in de bestaanspraktijken, en met name tot het verdwijnen van _medicine-men_, de traditionele dragers van spirituele kennis, hoogstwaarschijnlijk inclusief etnoastronomische kennis.\n"
"\n"
"Als gevolg hiervan lijkt de moderne kennis over hemellichamen slechts een fractie te zijn van wat de Lokono in het verleden over sterren wist. Verschillende sterrenbeelden die in oudere bronnen worden genoemd, zijn vergeten of zijn alleen bekend uit hun naam, terwijl de combinaties van sterren die ze vertegenwoordigen en de mondelinge tradities die hun oorsprong en betekenis verklaren, zijn vergeten. De hier gepresenteerde luchtcultuur omvat alleen geïdentificeerde sterrenbeelden, maar de volgende beschrijving geeft een uitgebreider verslag van de astronomische kennis van Lokono, inclusief informatie uit historische bronnen over alle hemellichamen die in de onderstaande tabel worden genoemd.\n"

"### Lokono astronomische kennis: een inleiding\n"
"\n"
"Uit hedendaagse en historische verslagen blijkt dat astronomische kennis niet beperkt was tot bepaalde leden van de Lokono-samenleving. Het waren echter vooral de medicijnmannen - de spirituele leiders van de Lokono die bekend staan als _semethi_ - die de verschillende aspecten van sterrenkennis moesten beheersen en die mogelijk verantwoordelijk waren geweest voor het doorgeven van de mondelinge tradities die daarmee samenhingen van de ene generatie naar de andere. een ander. Van Rodrigo de Navarette, die rond 1550 een van de eerste verslagen van de Lokono schreef, leren we bijvoorbeeld dat: “oude en wijze mannen die ze _Cemetu_ noemen, zich verzamelen in de huizen die zijn ontworpen voor hun vergaderingen en (...) vertellen de tradities en heldendaden van hun voorouders en grote mannen, en vertellen ook wat die voorouders van hun voorouders hoorden; zodat ze op deze manier de oudste gebeurtenissen van hun land en volk herinneren. En op dezelfde manier vertellen of prediken ze over gebeurtenissen die betrekking hebben op de hemel, de zon, de maan en de sterren. '[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, de medicijnmannen die in het moderne Lokono bekend staan als _semethi_, hebben hun praktijken vandaag grotendeels opgegeven, wat de reden kan zijn waarom de overdracht van astronomische kennis is onderbroken. Veel Lokono-sterrenbeelden lijken tegenwoordig te zijn vergeten. Onze bronnen zijn daarom vaak beperkt tot historische verslagen die zijn geschreven door vroege ontdekkingsreizigers en etnografen van de Guianas, waarvan een van de oudste voorbeelden hieronder wordt geïllustreerd.\n"

"Het is deze literatuur die ons in staat stelt om de Lokono stellaire kennis, die hieronder wordt beschreven, te reconstrueren. Voordat we de afzonderlijke hemellichamen bespreken, verdienen verschillende algemene kenmerken van de Lokono-astronomie een vermelding, namelijk:\n"
"\n"
"* de overlap met de astronomische tradities van naburige inheemse groepen.\n"
"* de mondelinge tradities die de oorsprong en betekenis van hemellichamen verklaren.\n"
"* het gebruik van de term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in de namen van talloze sterrenbeelden.\n"
"* het gebruik van de algemene term _wiwa_ 'ster, jaar' en het ontbreken van andere astronomische termen.\n"
"* de luchtkijkpraktijken van de Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Gedeelde kennis van Guian\n"
"\n"
"Het Lokono-gebied grenst aan dat van twee linguïstisch niet-verwante inheemse volkeren, de Kari'na, die een Caribische taal spreekt, en de Warao, die een geïsoleerde taal spreekt. Hoewel ze niet verwant zijn en traditioneel niet onderling trouwen, delen de drie groepen veel materiële en immateriële cultuur. Etnoastronomische traditie van de drie volkeren vertoont ook een aantal opvallende overeenkomsten, zoals gedeelde stellaire mythen, vergelijkbare namen van sterrenbeelden en parallellen op de stellaire kalender. Dit spreekt tot de contacten tussen de drie groepen en tot de uitwisseling van astronomische kennis, mogelijk gefaciliteerd door hun respectievelijke spirituele leiders, zoals de Lokono _semethi_. De mate waarin deze tradities elkaar overlappen en de gerichtheid van hun uitwisseling behoeven nader onderzoek. Hier concentreren we ons op de Lokono en bespreken daarom deze culturele leningen niet in detail, tenzij ze licht werpen op de Lokono-etnoastronomie.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellaire mondelinge tradities\n"
"\n"
"Een van deze gedeelde kenmerken zijn mythes over sterren. Dergelijke orale tradities vertellen over de oorsprong van bepaalde hemellichamen, verbinden ze met elkaar en verklaren hun invloed op de natuurlijke wereld. Het Lokono-sterrenbeeld _Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, bijvoorbeeld, is in een Lokono-mythe verbonden met die van _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ en _ Alêti_ ‘Torch’, die alle drie Kari’na en Warao-equivalenten hebben. Het zijn deze mondelinge tradities, bewaard door de medicijnmannen, die waarschijnlijk dienden als het belangrijkste voertuig waardoor astronomische kennis van de ene generatie op de andere werd doorgegeven. Daarom worden samenvattingen van de relevante mythen gegeven in de beschrijving van bepaalde sterrenbeelden. Af en toe, wanneer de relevante Lokono-mythe niet gedocumenteerd is, wordt verwezen naar mythen van de naburige groepen om de betekenis van bepaalde hemellichamen te belichten. Aangezien veel van dergelijke orale tradities worden gedeeld door de Lokono en de naburige groepen, is deze verbetering van de slecht bewaarde astronomische kennis van Lokono gerechtvaardigd.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Kalender van geesten\n"
"\n"
"De term _koya_ ‘geest’, die in tal van constellatienamen voorkomt, die typisch een term voor een bepaalde plant of dier volgen, is een belangrijk kenmerk van de Lokono-astronomie. Walter Roth, een etnograaf van de Guianas, legt uit dat dergelijke sterrenbeelden de geesten zijn van de corresponderende wezens. [#4] In een tijd van het jaar waarin het sterrenbeeld verschijnt, reist de geest van de lucht naar de aarde om leven te blazen in de wezens die het zijn vertegenwoordigt. Als zodanig vormden de _koya_-sterrenbeelden een kalender, die aangeeft wat de beste tijd is om deel te nemen aan zelfvoorzienende activiteiten met betrekking tot deze planten en dieren (bijvoorbeeld jagen of verzamelen). De Lokono wist misschien ook waar zulke geesten op aarde zouden neerdalen; Walter Roth suggereert dat ze deze plaatsen met dezelfde namen noemden als de sterrenbeelden, maar het bewijs daarvoor blijft slecht. Dus, _Hadorhikoya_ ‘Geest van de rode acouchi’ zou verwijzen naar de geest, het sterrenbeeld en de plaats waar de _hadorhi_ in overvloed wordt gevonden wanneer het sterrenbeeld verschijnt. Hoewel deze toponieme kennis tegenwoordig wordt vergeten, herinneren de _koya_-constellaties ons aan het grote begrip van het planten- en dierenleven dat de Lokono bezat.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, de ster en het jaar\n"
"\n"
"De Lokono hebben ook een andere algemene term die wordt gebruikt om naar sterren te verwijzen, _wiwa_. De term mist de spirituele connotaties van _koya._ Het verwijst enerzijds naar de fysieke kwaliteit van sterren als iets dat schijnt en, anderzijds, naar het kalenderjaar. Als zodanig wordt het bijvoorbeeld gebruikt bij het praten over iemands leeftijd. Hoewel het op elke ster van toepassing kan zijn, verschijnt _wiwa_ slechts in twee eigennamen van hemellichamen. _Yôkoro wiwa_, letterlijk ‘Scores of stars’ (Pleiaden), is de belangrijkste van alle Lokono-constellaties, waarvan het uiterlijk traditioneel begint in het Lokono-kalenderjaar. Na _Yôkoro wiwa_ volgen de talrijke _koya_-sterrenbeelden, die elk een ander seizoen in de Lokono-kalender aangeven. Aan de andere kant lijkt _Wiwa kalemero_, letterlijk ‘Shining star’ (Jupiter) te zijn onderscheiden vanwege de helderheid. Afgezien van _wiwa_ en _koya_ zijn er geen generieke termen die planeten, sterren, manen, zonnen, sterrenstelsels enzovoort onderscheiden in de Lokono-taal. Om deze reden wordt bijvoorbeeld het Lokono-equivalent van de Melkweg onder andere sterrenbeelden opgenomen.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Luchtkijkpraktijken\n"
"\n"
"Terwijl de Lokono 's avonds de hemel kan bewonderen, moet men om de Lokono-stellaire kalender te volgen, rond 4 uur' s ochtends naar de sterrenbeelden kijken, de tijd dat de Lokono gewoonlijk wakker wordt. De Lokono observeren dus de opkomst van de sterrenbeelden in de ochtend. Om een goed beeld te krijgen van de jaarlijkse cyclus van sterrenbeelden, moet men ook de kijklocatie instellen op de Guianas (bijvoorbeeld Georgetown, Paramaribo of Cayenne in het locatiemenu). Het verdient een vermelding dat veel Lokono bij het tekenen van sterrenbeelden de sterren niet met lijnen verbond en dat er in sommige gevallen weinig overeenstemming was onder de sprekers over welke ster binnen een sterrenbeeld overeenkomt met welke delen van de plant of het dier het vertegenwoordigt. In Stellarium vertegenwoordigen we sterrenbeelden met lijnen, maar er moet rekening mee worden gehouden dat dit een verstoring van de Lokono-traditie kan zijn, wat zorgt voor meer flexibiliteit bij het interpreteren van bepaalde stergroepen. Ten slotte zijn er beperkingen bij het kijken naar sommige hemellichamen, omdat men gelooft dat een spuit iemand kan schaden als men naar [#5] kijkt. Zo bedekten moeders bij volle maan de ogen van hun kinderen zodat ze niet ziek zouden worden [#6]. Jongeren kregen ook te horen dat ze niet naar _Yôkoro wiwa_ (Pleiaden) moesten kijken, anders zouden ze niet groeien [#7]. Dergelijke praktijken werden ook toegepast op andere voorwerpen waarvan wordt aangenomen dat ze sterke geesten bevatten en omvatten andere manieren om oogcontact met sterke drank te vermijden, zoals het wrijven van pepers, limoenen of zout in iemands ogen.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono hemellichamen\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"De Lokono-term voor de zon is _Hadali_, ook uitgesproken als _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje suggereert dat de verschillend gespelde namen van de Lokono-cultuurheld, de eerste medicijnman bekend als _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_, _Hariwalli_ en _Arawanili_, en soms _Arawidi_, allemaal kunnen verwijzen naar dezelfde held die wordt geïdentificeerd als de zon [#8]. Hoewel we deze hypothese niet kunnen bevestigen, is de mythe van _Arawidi_ het vermelden waard. In de Lokono-mythe is _Arawidi_, de zon, de vader van een man die het sterrenbeeld _Mabukuli_ ‘Man zonder dij’ wordt (Orions riem) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Volgens het verhaal kwam de zon naar de aarde in de vorm van een man genaamd _Arawidi_ om zijn geliefde te ontmoeten met wie hij een tweeling had. In een latere aflevering van de mythe trouwt een van de tweelingen met een vrouw, wiens moeder het paar besluit te doden. Wanneer ze proberen te ontsnappen, achtervolgt de zus van de vrouw hen en slaagt erin zijn wraakbeen af te snijden. Als gevolg hiervan stijgt de man naar de hemel en wordt het sterrenbeeld _Mabukuli_. Een andere Lokono-mythe waarschuwt voor het beledigen van de zon: een man, vast op een onbewoond eiland midden in een moeras, schreeuwt om hulp. Een boot passeert hem, maar in de boot zit de zon, die de man niet wil helpen, aangezien mensen altijd klagen dat de zon te hard schijnt [#11]. Wat praktijken met betrekking tot de zon betreft, meldde Im Thurn dat onder de Lokono de zonsverduistering werd beschouwd als een oorlog tussen _Hadali_ en _Kathi_, de maan, en dat de Lokono zou schreeuwen en allerlei geluiden zou maken om hen ervan te weerhouden vechten [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Maan'\n"
"\n"
"De maan staat bekend als _Kathi_, een term die voor het eerst door Joannes de Laet werd geregistreerd als _cattehee_ rond 1598, en werd ook gebruikt om te verwijzen naar de maanmaand [#13]. Volgens de Lokono was de maan, net als de zon, ooit een man. Walter Roth doet verslag van een Lokono-mythe, waarin een jonge vrouw nacht na nacht werd bezocht door een mysterieuze minnaar [#10]. Om erachter te komen wie de minnaar was, smeerde de vrouw haar handen in met het roet van de bodem van een pot. Toen ze de volgende dag wakker werd, ontdekte ze dat het gezicht van haar broer onder het roet zat en besefte dat hij het was die haar 's nachts bezocht. Iedereen in haar gemeenschap begon de incestueuze broer te vermijden, die zich zo schaamde dat hij weg bleef van de mensen en uiteindelijk naar de hemel steeg en de maan werd. Dit is waarom, volgens de Lokono, het gezicht van de maan vandaag vuil is. De maan komt ook voor in een andere mythe. In de Lokono-mythe over een man die vastzit op een onbewoond eiland dat hierboven wordt genoemd, passeert een andere boot de man, maar deze keer binnen is de maan, die besluit de man te helpen, omdat mensen altijd blij zijn om de maan 's nachts naar buiten te zien komen [#11]. De maan en de zon worden ook afgebeeld als tegenstanders. In eerdere tijden geloofde de Lokono dat de maansverduistering de dood is (_kathi ôdon_ 'maan sterft') en zou ze de hele nacht waken. [#6] De Lokono zegt tijdens de maansverduistering dat de maan in slaap is gevallen het pad van de zon [#11]. Daarom maken ze veel lawaai, bespelen ze drums en blazen ze op trompetten om hem wakker te maken. Bij volle maan zouden moeders de ogen van hun kinderen bedekken zodat ze niet ziek worden.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"De planeet Venus, zowel wanneer hij 's ochtends verschijnt als de Morgenster en wanneer hij' s avonds verschijnt als de Avondster, wordt door de Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15] _Warhokoma_ genoemd. Charles Dance rapporteert daarentegen de termen _Eweiwah_ en _Huewah_, waarschijnlijk de equivalenten van de algemene term _wiwa_\n"
"‘Ster’ die kan worden gebruikt voor elk glanzend hemellichaam [#16]. De Lokono spreken ook over Venus als _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘vrouwenster’. In verband hiermee verdient het vermelding dat Claudius de Goeje meldt dat wanneer _Hiyaro wiwa_ dicht bij de maan verschijnt en een meisje op het punt staat haar eerste menstruatie te krijgen, de Lokono zegt dat het meisje spoedig zal worden aangeraakt door de maan [#5]. Er is geen mythe over specifiek Warhokoma_ en zijn relatie tot de maan, maar het is de moeite waard eraan te herinneren dat de Lokono een verhaal kennen, waarin de maan oorspronkelijk een man was die incest pleegde met zijn zus (zie de mythe genoemd onder _Kathi_), en heeft een naam als rokkenjager [#10]. Interessant is dat de naam _Warhokoma_ voor Morning or Evening Star ook voorkomt in Kari’na, die het ook ziet als de vrouw van de maan [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Melkweg'\n"
"\n"
"De Melkweg staat bij de Lokono letterlijk bekend als _Waya nukuthi bunaha_\n"
"‘Pad van de dragers van klei’. De Melkweg vertegenwoordigt de voetafdrukken van mannen die ooit klei gingen halen om potten te maken, een kunst die tegenwoordig zelden of helemaal niet wordt beoefend door de Lokono. De oorsprong van de naam is echter nog steeds bekend en wordt samengevat in een mythe [#19]. Dezelfde naam voor Melkweg werd opgemerkt door William Brett, die eraan toevoegt dat deze is vernoemd naar een specifieke witachtige kleisoort [#14]. Charles Dance daarentegen zegt dat de Melkweg de voetafdrukken vertegenwoordigt van pekari's die de klei uitwortelen, terwijl Walter Roth een andere Lokono-verklaring noemt, volgens welke de Melkweg een tapir vertegenwoordigt die wordt achtervolgd door een hond en een jaguar [#10] [#16]. Deze twee bronnen geven echter niet de corresponderende Lokono-naam voor de Melkweg en het is mogelijk dat deze twee verklaringen een Kari'na-invloed zijn, die een sterrenbeeld van een tijger herkennen volgens het sterrenbeeld van een tapir in dat van de Melkweg Manier [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"De moderne Lokono noemt Sirius _Mali_, waarvan de letterlijke betekenis onbekend is. Cornelius van Coll beschrijft een Lokono-ster genaamd _Mali_ en legt uit dat het een zeer krachtige ster is [#7] [#17]. Als het 's ochtends in augustus opkomt, doodt het de vis in de moerassen, en je mag er niet naar wijzen, anders wordt je vinger kreupel. De _Mali_ van Cornelius van Coll markeert het begin van het grote droge seizoen (augustus tot december), genaamd Lokono _malidalithe_, een term afgeleid van _Mali_. Oudere bronnen identificeerden _Mali_ voorlopig als Lyra, Aquila of Crux, maar aangezien het grote droge seizoen rond augustus begint en de Lokono 's ochtends de sterren waarnemen, moeten deze identificaties onjuist zijn; Lyra, Aquila en Crux kunnen op dit moment niet worden gezien vanuit de Lokono-gebieden [#11] [#17]. Er zijn geen Lokono-mythen over _Mali_, maar er is bewijs dat mogelijk overeenkomt met het Kari’na-sterrenbeeld _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Vorig gezicht’. De Kari'na-mythen verklaren de oorsprong van het sterrenbeeld en de naam ervan, waarvan wordt aangenomen dat het, net als de Lokono _Mali_, de vissen in de moerassen doodt en het begin van het grote droge seizoen aankondigt. Bovendien wordt de Kari’na _Ombatapo_ geïdentificeerd als delen van Puppis en Canis Major, waarvan de laatste Sirius [#18] [#20] omvat."

"werd genoemd door de gebroeders Penard en Claudius de Goeje maar bleef tot "
"nu toe onbekend. [#11], [#17] De hedendaagse Lokono aan de Pomeroon-rivier "
"in Guyana herkent het in delen van het westelijke sterrenbeeld Corona "
"Australis. Er zijn geen mythen met betrekking tot dit sterrenbeeld, maar de "
"Lokono zeggen dat wanneer de kop van de eend naar de grond wijst en de eend "
"met zijn kop onder water lijkt te zijn, hij zich bezig houdt met planten. De"
" constellatie neemt deze positie vanaf half mei in. Op dit moment wordt "
"gezegd dat de vogels gemakkelijker te vangen zijn. De Barbarijse eend wordt "
"beschouwd als een delicatesse en wordt ook vaak als kippen in huis gehouden."
