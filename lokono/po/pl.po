"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"_Lokono_, znany również jako _Arawak_, to rdzenni mieszkańcy Gujany, których terytorium rozciąga się wzdłuż wybrzeża Oceanu Atlantyckiego, od północno-zachodniej Gujany, przez Surinam, po północno-zachodnią Gujanę Francuską (patrz mapa) [#1]. Lokono mówią językiem należącym do rodziny języków Arawakan, jednej z największych grup językowych na kontynencie. Podobnie jak wielu ich krewnych językowych, Lokono to rolnicy specjalizujący się w hodowli manioku (Mananihot esculenta), którzy również praktykują łowienie ryb, polowanie i zbieranie dzikich roślin. Jednak, jako jedna z pierwszych grup tubylczych, które napotkali Europejczycy w czasie podboju, Lokono pozostaje w kontakcie z nierodzimymi populacjami od ponad 500 lat [#2]. Ten kontakt zintensyfikował się w ostatnim stuleciu, co doprowadziło do znacznej utraty języka Lokono, tradycyjnej kultury materialnej i niematerialnej, zmian w praktykach związanych z utrzymaniem, a w szczególności do zniknięcia „ludzi medycyny”, tradycyjnych nośników wiedzy duchowej, najprawdopodobniej w tym wiedza etnoastronomiczna.\n"

"W rezultacie współczesna wiedza na temat ciał niebieskich wydaje się być jedynie ułamkiem tego, co Lokono wiedział o gwiazdach w przeszłości.

"### Wiedza astronomiczna Lokono: wprowadzenie\n"
"\n"
"Ze współczesnych i historycznych relacji wynika, że wiedza astronomiczna nie była ograniczona do konkretnych członków społeczeństwa Lokono. Jednak w szczególności lekarze - duchowi przywódcy Lokono znani jako _semethi - byli zobowiązani do opanowania różnych aspektów wiedzy o gwiazdach i mogli być odpowiedzialni za przekazywanie związanych z nimi tradycji ustnych z pokolenia na pokolenie inne. Od Rodrigo de Navarette, który około 1550 r. Napisał jedno z pierwszych relacji Lokono, dowiadujemy się na przykład, że: „starzy i mądrzy ludzie, których nazywają Cemetu”, gromadzą się w domach przeznaczonych na ich spotkania i (...) opowiadają tradycje i wyczyny ich przodków i wielkich ludzi, a także opowiadają, co ci przodkowie słyszeli od swoich przodków; aby w ten sposób pamiętali najstarsze wydarzenia w ich kraju i ludziach. I w podobny sposób opowiadają lub głoszą o wydarzeniach związanych z niebiosami, słońcem, księżycem i gwiazdami. ”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navcem, _cemetu_, lekarze znani we współczesnym Lokono jako _semethi_, w dużej mierze zrezygnowali dziś ze swoich praktyk, co może być przyczyną przerwania transmisji wiedzy astronomicznej. Wydaje się, że wiele konstelacji Lokono zostało dziś zapomnianych. Dlatego nasze źródła często ograniczają się do historycznych relacji pisanych przez pierwszych odkrywców i etnografów z Gujany, których jeden z najstarszych przykładów ilustruje poniższy rysunek.\n"

"To właśnie ta literatura pozwala nam na zabawę odtworzyć gwiezdną wiedzę Lokono, opisaną poniżej. Przed omówieniem poszczególnych ciał niebieskich warto jednak wspomnieć o kilku ogólnych cechach astronomii Lokono:\n"
"\n"
"* pokrywają się z astronomicznymi tradycjami sąsiednich grup tubylczych.\n"
"* ustne tradycje wyjaśniające pochodzenie i znaczenie ciał niebieskich.\n"
"* użycie terminu „duch” w nazwach wielu konstelacji.\n"
"* użycie ogólnego terminu _wiwa_ „gwiazda, rok” i brak innych terminów astronomicznych.\n"
"* praktyki Lokono obserwujące niebo.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Dzielona wiedza Guianan\n"
"\n"
"Terytorium Lokono graniczy z terytorium dwóch niezwiązanych językowo rdzennych ludów: Kari’na, posługująca się językiem karibańskim, i Warao, posługująca się językiem izolowanym. Mimo że te trzy grupy są ze sobą niezwiązane i tradycyjnie nie zawarły związków małżeńskich, łączy je wiele kultury materialnej i niematerialnej. Etnoastronomiczna tradycja trzech ludów wykazuje także wiele uderzających podobieństw, takich jak wspólne mity gwiezdne, podobne nazwy gwiazdozbiorów i podobieństwa w kalendarzu gwiezdnym. Dotyczy to kontaktów między trzema grupami oraz wymiany wiedzy astronomicznej, prawdopodobnie ułatwionej przez ich odpowiednich duchowych przywódców, takich jak Lokono _semethi_. Stopień nakładania się tych tradycji i kierunkowość ich wymiany wymagają dalszych badań. Tutaj skupiamy się na Lokono i dlatego nie omawiamy szczegółowo tych zapożyczeń kulturowych, chyba że rzucą one światło na etnoastronomię Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Gwiezdne tradycje ustne\n"
"\n"
"Jedną z takich wspólnych cech są mity o gwiazdach. Takie ustne tradycje mówią o pochodzeniu poszczególnych ciał niebieskich, łączą je ze sobą i wyjaśniają ich wpływ na świat przyrody. Na przykład konstelacja Lokono _Hithikoya_ „Duch czarnej curassow” jest powiązana w micie lokono z mitem _Yokhârhin_ „Hunter” i _Alêti_ „Torch”, z których wszystkie trzy mają odpowiedniki Kari’na i Warao. To te ustne tradycje, zachowane przez lekarzy, prawdopodobnie służyły jako główny nośnik, przez który wiedza astronomiczna była przekazywana z pokolenia na pokolenie. Z tego powodu streszczenia odpowiednich mitów podano w opisie poszczególnych konstelacji. Czasami, gdy odpowiedni mit Lokono nie jest udokumentowany, przywoływane są mity o sąsiednich grupach, aby wyjaśnić znaczenie poszczególnych ciał niebieskich. Biorąc pod uwagę, że wiele takich ustnych tradycji jest podzielanych przez Lokono i sąsiednie grupy, to ulepszenie źle zachowanej wiedzy astronomicznej Lokono jest uzasadnione.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Kalendarz duchów\n"
"\n"
"Termin „duch”, znajdujący się w wielu nazwach konstelacji zwykle następujących po nazwie konkretnej rośliny lub zwierzęcia, jest kluczową cechą astronomii Lokono. Walter Roth, etnograf z Gujany, wyjaśnia, że takie konstelacje są duchami odpowiednich istot. [#4] W czasie roku, w którym pojawia się konstelacja, duch podróżuje z nieba na ziemię, aby tchnąć życie w istoty reprezentuje. Jako takie, konstelacje _koya_ utworzyły kalendarz, wskazujący najlepszy czas na podjęcie działań związanych z utrzymaniem tych roślin i zwierząt (np. Polowanie lub zbieranie). Lokono mógł również wiedzieć, gdzie takie duchy zstąpią na ziemię; Walter Roth sugeruje, że nazwali te miejsca tymi samymi nazwami co konstelacje, ale dowody na to pozostają słabe. W ten sposób _Hadorhikoya_ „Duch czerwonych acouchi” odnosi się do ducha, konstelacji i miejsca, w którym _hadorhi_ występuje w dużej ilości, gdy pojawia się jego konstelacja. Podczas gdy ta wiedza toponimiczna jest dziś zapomniana, konstelacje _koya_ przypominają nam o wielkim zrozumieniu życia roślinnego i zwierzęcego, jakie posiadał Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, gwiazda i rok\n"
"\n"
"Lokono ma również inny ogólny termin używany w odniesieniu do gwiazd, _wiwa_. Termin ten nie ma duchowych konotacji _koya. Z jednej strony odnosi się do fizycznej jakości gwiazd jako czegoś świecącego, az drugiej strony do roku kalendarzowego. Jako taki jest używany na przykład, gdy mówi się o wieku. Chociaż może odnosić się do dowolnej gwiazdy, _wiwa_ pojawia się tylko w dwóch prawidłowych nazwach ciał niebieskich. _Yôkoro wiwa_, dosłownie „Wyniki gwiazd” (Plejady), jest najważniejszą ze wszystkich konstelacji Lokono, których pojawienie się tradycyjnie rozpoczyna rok kalendarzowy Lokono. Po _Yôkoro wiwa_ znajdują się liczne konstelacje _koya_, z których każda sygnalizuje inny sezon w kalendarzu Lokono. Z drugiej strony, _Wiwa kalemero_, dosłownie „Świecąca gwiazda” (Jowisz) wydaje się wyróżniona wyłącznie ze względu na swoją jasność. Oprócz _wiwa_ i _koya_, w języku Lokono nie ma ogólnych określeń odróżniających planety, gwiazdy, księżyce, słońca, galaktyki i tak dalej. Z tego powodu na przykład odpowiednik Lokono Drogi Mlecznej zaliczany jest do innych konstelacji.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Praktyki oglądania nieba\n"
"\n"
"Podczas gdy Lokono może podziwiać niebo wieczorem, aby postępować zgodnie z gwiezdnym kalendarzem Lokono, trzeba spojrzeć na konstelacje około 4 rano, kiedy zwykle Lokono się budzi. Lokono obserwują więc wschodzące konstelacje rano. Aby uzyskać właściwy obraz rocznego cyklu konstelacji, należy również ustawić lokalizację wyświetlania na Guianas (np. Georgetown, Paramaribo lub Cayenne w menu lokalizacji). Warto wspomnieć, że wiele Lokono podczas rysowania gwiazdozbiorów nie łączyło gwiazd z liniami i że w niektórych przypadkach głośniki nie były zgodne co do tego, która gwiazda w gwiazdozbiorze odpowiada, które części rośliny lub zwierzęcia reprezentuje. W Stellarium reprezentujemy konstelacje za pomocą linii, ale należy pamiętać, że może to być zniekształcenie tradycji Lokono, co pozwala na większą elastyczność w interpretacji określonych grup gwiazd. Wreszcie, istnieją ograniczenia dotyczące patrzenia na niektóre ciała niebieskie, ponieważ uważa się, że spirt może zaszkodzić jednemu, jeśli spojrzy się na [#5]. Na przykład przy pełni księżyca matki zakryły oczy swoich dzieci, aby nie zachorowały [#6]. Młodym ludziom powiedziano także, aby nie patrzyli na _Yôkoro wiwa_ (Plejady), w przeciwnym razie nie będą się rozwijać [#7]. Takie praktyki stosowano także do innych obiektów, które prawdopodobnie zawierają potężne duchy, i obejmowały inne sposoby unikania kontaktu wzrokowego z duchami, takie jak pocieranie papryki, limonki lub soli w oczy.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono ciała niebieskie\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ „Sun”\n"
"\n"
"Termin Lokono na Słońce to _Hadali_, również wymawiane jako _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje sugeruje, że różnorodnie pisane imiona bohatera kultury Lokono, pierwszego człowieka medycyny znanego jako _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_, _Hariwalli_ i _Arawanili_, a czasami _Arawidi_, mogą odnosić się do tego samego bohatera zidentyfikowanego jako Słońce [#8]. Chociaż nie możemy potwierdzić tej hipotezy, warto wspomnieć o micie „Arawidi”. W micie Lokono, _Arawidi_, Słońce, jest ojcem człowieka, który staje się konstelacją _Mabukuli_ „Człowiek bez uda” (pas Oriona) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Według tej historii Słońce przyszło na ziemię w kształcie człowieka o imieniu Arawidi, aby spotkać swojego kochanka, z którym miał bliźniaki. W późniejszym odcinku mitu jedno z bliźniaków poślubia kobietę, której matka postanawia zabić. Kiedy próbują uciec, siostra żony goni ich i udaje mu się odciąć nogę z zemsty. W rezultacie mężczyzna wstępuje do nieba i staje się konstelacją _Mabukuli_. Kolejny mit Lokono ostrzega przed obrażeniem Słońca: człowiek utknięty na bezludnej wyspie pośrodku bagna woła o pomoc. Łódź mija go, ale w środku jest Słońce, które nie chce mu pomóc, ponieważ ludzie zawsze narzekają, że Słońce świeci zbyt mocno [#11]. Jeśli chodzi o praktyki związane ze Słońcem, Im Thurn poinformował, że za Lokono zaćmienie Słońca uważane było za wojnę między _Hadali_ i _Kathi_ Księżycem, a Lokono krzyczał i wydawał wszelkiego rodzaju dźwięki, aby powstrzymać ich od walka [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"Księżyc jest znany jako _Kathi_, termin po raz pierwszy zapisany przez Joannes de Laet jako _cattehee_ około 1598 roku i używany również w odniesieniu do miesiąca księżycowego [#13]. Według Lokono Księżyc, podobnie jak Słońce, był kiedyś człowiekiem. Walter Roth relacjonuje mit Lokono, w którym tajemniczą kochankę odwiedza młoda kobieta noc po nocy [#10]. Aby dowiedzieć się, kim był kochanek, kobieta posmarowała dłonie sadzą z dna garnka. Następnego dnia, kiedy się obudziła, odkryła, że twarz jej brata była pokryta sadzą i zdała sobie sprawę, że to on odwiedził ją w nocy. Wszyscy w jej społeczności zaczęli unikać kazirodczego brata, który wstydził się tak bardzo, że trzymał się z dala od ludzi i ostatecznie wzniósł się w niebo, stając się Księżycem. Dlatego według Lokono twarz księżyca jest dziś brudna. Księżyc pojawia się również w innym micie. W micie Lokono o człowieku, który utknął na wspomnianej wyżej bezludnej wyspie, inna łódź mija go, ale tym razem w środku jest Księżyc, który decyduje się mu pomóc, ponieważ ludzie zawsze cieszą się, że Księżyc wychodzi nocą [#11]. Księżyc i Słońce są również przedstawiane jako przeciwnicy. W poprzednich czasach Lokono wierzył, że zaćmienie Księżyca jest jego śmiercią (_kathi ôdon_ „umierający księżyc”) i będzie czuwał przez całą noc. [#6] Lokono mówią podczas zaćmienia Księżyca, że Księżyc zasnął ścieżka Słońca [#11]. Dlatego robią dużo hałasu, grają na perkusji i dmuchają w trąby, aby go obudzić. W pełni księżyca matki zakrywają oczy swoich dzieci, aby nie zachorowały.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"Planeta Wenus, zarówno gdy pojawia się rano jako Gwiazda Poranna, jak i wieczorem jako Gwiazda Wieczorna, jest nazywana przez Lokono [WarXokoma_] [#8] [#14] [#15]. Charles Dance z kolei podaje terminy _wewe_ i _wewa_, prawdopodobnie odpowiedniki ogólnego terminu _wiwa_\n"
"„Gwiazda”, której można użyć do dowolnego świecącego ciała niebieskiego [#16]. Lokono mówi również o Wenus jako o „kobiecej kobiecie” Hiiyaro wiwa_. W związku z tym warto wspomnieć, że Claudius de Goeje donosi, że kiedy _Hiyaro wiwa_ pojawi się blisko Księżyca, a dziewczyna ma mieć pierwszą miesiączkę, Lokono mówi, że wkrótce dziewczyna zostanie dotknięta przez Księżyc [#5]. Nie ma mitu na temat _Warhokoma_ i jego związku z Księżycem, ale warto przypomnieć, że Lokono zna historię, w której Księżyc był pierwotnie człowiekiem, który popełnił kazirodztwo ze swoją siostrą (patrz mit wspomniany pod _Kathi_), i ma nazwę kobieciarza [#10]. Co ciekawe, nazwa _Warhokoma_ dla gwiazdy porannej lub wieczornej pojawia się również w Kari’nie, która postrzega ją także jako żonę Księżyca [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ „Droga Mleczna”\n"
"\n"
"Droga Mleczna jest znana wśród Lokono jako dosłownie „Waya nukuthi bunaha”\n"
"„Ścieżka nosicieli gliny”. Droga Mleczna przedstawia ślady mężczyzn, którzy kiedyś poszli po glinę do robienia garnków, sztukę, którą Rzadko dziś praktykuje się Lokono. Pochodzenie nazwy jest jednak nadal znane i zostało streszczone w mitach [#19]. Tę samą nazwę Drogi Mlecznej zauważył William Brett, który dodaje, że jej nazwa pochodzi od określonego białawego rodzaju gliny [#14]. Z kolei Charles Dance twierdzi, że Droga Mleczna przedstawia ślady pekari zakorzenionych w glinie, zaś Walter Roth wspomina o innym wytłumaczeniu Lokono, zgodnie z którym Droga Mleczna przedstawia tapir ścigany przez psa i jaguara [#10] [#16]. Jednak te dwa źródła nie podają odpowiedniej nazwy Lokono dla Drogi Mlecznej i możliwe jest, że te dwa wyjaśnienia są wpływem Kari'na, który rozpoznaje konstelację tygrysa po konstelacji tapira w obrębie konstelacji tapiru Sposób [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ „Sirius”\n"
"\n"
"Nowoczesne Lokono nazywa Sirius _Mali_, którego dosłowne znaczenie jest nieznane. Cornelius van Coll opisuje gwiazdę Lokono o nazwie _Mali_ i wyjaśnia, że jest to bardzo potężna gwiazda [#7] [#17]. Kiedy pojawia się rano w sierpniu, zabija rybę na bagnach i nie należy na niego wskazywać, inaczej palec stanie się kulawy. Cornelius van Coll's _Mali_ oznacza początek dużej pory suchej (od sierpnia do grudnia), zwanej w Lokono _malidalithe_, terminem wywodzącym się z _Mali_. Starsze źródła identyfikowały _Mali_ wstępnie jako Lyra, Aquila lub Crux, ale biorąc pod uwagę, że duża pora sucha rozpoczyna się około sierpnia i że Lokono obserwuje gwiazdy rano, identyfikacje te muszą być niepoprawne; Lyra, Aquila i Crux nie są obecnie widoczne z terytoriów Lokono [#11] [#17]. Nie ma mitów Lokono na temat _Mali_, ale istnieją dowody, które mogą odpowiadać konstelacji Kari _Ombatapo_\n"
"„Poprzednia twarz”. Mity Kari wyjaśniają pochodzenie konstelacji i jej nazwę, która, podobnie jak Lokono _Mali_, ma zabijać ryby na bagnach i zapowiada początek dużej pory suchej. Co więcej, Kari'na _Ombatapo_ jest identyfikowana jako część Puppis i Canis Major, z których ta ostatnia obejmuje Siriusa [#18] [#20]."
