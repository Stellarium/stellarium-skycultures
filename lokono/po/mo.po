"\n"
"The _Lokono_, also known as _Arawak_, are an indigenous people of the Guianas,\n"
"whose territory stretches along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, from\n"
"northwestern Guyana, through Suriname, to northwestern French Guiana (see\n"
"map) [#1]. The Lokono speak a language that belongs to the Arawakan language\n"
"family, one of the largest linguistic groupings on the continent. Like many of\n"
"their linguistic relatives, the Lokono are agriculturalists specializing in the\n"
"farming of manioc (_Manihot esculenta_), who also practice fishing, hunting,\n"
"and gathering of wild plant. However, as one of the first indigenous groups\n"
"that was encountered by the Europeans at the time of conquest, the Lokono have\n"
"been in contact with non-indigenous populations for over 500 years [#2]. This\n"
"contact has intensified in the last century, leading to a substantial loss of\n"
"the Lokono language, traditional material and immaterial culture, changes in\n"
"subsistence practices, and in particular to the disappearance of _medicine-men_,\n"
"the traditional carriers of spiritual knowledge, most likely including\n"
"ethnoastronomical knowledge.\n"
"\n"
"As a consequence, the modern knowledge about celestial bodies appears to be but\n"
"a fraction of what the Lokono knew about stars in the past. Several\n"
"constellations mentioned in older sources are forgotten or are only known from\n"
"their names, while the combinations of stars they represent and the oral\n"
"traditions explaining their origin and significance have been forgotten. The\n"

"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"The constellation _Hithikoya_ is the ‘Spirit of the black curassow’ (_Crax\n"
"alector_), a commonly hunted bird, often kept as a pet for its feathers and\n"
"eggs. According to a Lokono myth, _Hithikoya_ lived on earth, but the Lokono\n"
"kept shooting him.[#11] As a result, he ascended to the sky to warn black\n"
"curassows about the approaching hunter (see _Yokhârhin_) and his companion with\n"
"a torch (see _Alêti_). The Lokono identify _Hithikoya_ as the Western\n"
"constellation Crux. When it appears just above the trees in January, the\n"
"curassows roam on the ground and are easy to catch. Over the following months,\n"
"the higher _Hithikoya_ rises in the morning, the higher the birds climb up the\n"
"trees. By March, it appears high in the sky and the birds are found in the tops\n"
"of the trees. _Hithikoya_ thus informs the Lokono where to search for the birds\n"
"at a given time of the year. The Lokono even make hunting charms (_bina_) from\n"
"a plant, whose leaves resemble the bird, rubbed into the lips of the hunter so\n"
"that he can imitate the calls of the bird, increasing his chances of catching\n"
"one [#10][#17]."

# Description of Lokono constellation Grill
msgid ""
"The constellation _Yorhada_ ‘Grill’, or _Wiwa yorhadale_ ‘Star’s grill’,\n"
"represents a wooden grill, on which meat is roasted [#4][#11][#21]. Its origin\n"
"is explained in a myth related by Walter Roth about a man who killed his wife,\n"
"roasted her, and fed her liver to his mother-in-law because she called him a\n"
"worthless hunter [#10]. In revenge, the mother asked her brother, _Kamodo_ to\n"
"kill the man when he went hunting. The man suspected the woman set a trap and\n"
"escaped death by sending his brother instead. The grill on which the wife was\n"
"roasted became the Western constellation Pegasus, according to contemporary\n"
"Lokono, marking the beginning of the small dry season (April), the time when\n"
"the Lokono roast a lot of fish. The myth is similar to that of _Yôkoro wiwa_\n"
"and the twins, in which the older brother is responsible for roasting his wife\n"
"and may be the same as the man who roasted his wife in the _Yorhada_ myth. In\n"
"both myths, the younger brother killed by the anaconda becomes _Yôkoro wiwa_,\n"
"while the grill becomes _Yorhada_. Claudius de Goeje suggested that _Yorhada_\n"
"is the Western constellation Corvus, but Corvus does not appear at beginning of\n"
"the small dry season [#11]. The neighboring Warao also know Pegasus as the\n"
"grill, and are familiar with the myth [#10]."

# Description of Lokono constellation Scores of stars
msgid ""
"The constellation _Yôkoro wiwa_ or _Wiwa yôkoro_, literally ‘Score of stars’,\n"
"refers to the Pleiades and is easily recognized by the contemporary Lokono.\n"
"This is likely because _Yôkoro wiwa_ is described as the most important of\n"
"Lokono constellations, since it announce the beginning of the Lokono year [#17].\n"
"After it comes out first in June in the east, it is followed by the numerous\n"
"_koya_-constellations referring to the spirits of animals and plants that\n"
"constitute the Lokono calendar. At that time of the year, the Lokono say\n"
"_Yôkoro wiwa kayaran_ ‘the birth of _Yôkoro wiwa_’. It is said that if _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ shines strong when it appears for the first time, many people will die in\n"
"the coming year [#5]. Cornelius van Coll also warns that young people should not\n"
"look at it, or else they will not grow [#7]. These omens and warnings are\n"
"related to a Lokono myth. According to the story, there were once twin\n"
"brothers, one of which had a wife, and said that death would come when their\n"
"star, _Yôkoro Wiwa_, rises [#7]. Death came indeed, killing even his wife,\n"
"roasting her on the fire, and the Lokono became angry and brought a giant green\n"
"anaconda to swallow the twins. The snake ate one of the brothers, but because\n"
"it was already 5 am and the day broke, the snake could not eat the other\n"
"brother. The snake is now the constellation _Kamodokoya_ ‘Spirit of the green\n"
"anaconda’, in the belly of which _Yôkoro Wiwa_ is said to be located (see also\n"
"the _Yorhada_ myth). In another narrative, the Lokono explain that the _Yôkoro\n"
"Wiwa_ represents seven brothers lost in a savannah on their way back home, a\n"
"motif also known from a Kari'na story [#20]."

"The constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man without a thigh’ is well known among the\n"
"Lokono and appears in a few myths. According to Charles Dance, an unsuccessful\n"
"huntsman cut off his own leg, wrapped it up in a leaf, and gave to his step\n"
"mother so that she had something to eat, and ascended to sky.[#16] Similarly,\n"
"the Penard brothers speak of an unsuccessful hunter who cut off his leg and\n"

"then asked other people to follow his traces to help him bring the rest of the\n"

"with which he treated his wounds. His body turned into the _Kama tâla_\n"
"constellation and his spirit into _Mabukuli_. Claudius de Goeje relates a\n"
"strikingly different myth.[#11] The Sun, once a man called _Arawidi_ (see the\n"
"myth about _Hadali_ 'Sun'), took a woman as his wife, who followed him with\n"
"unborn twins inside her. One day, she lost the way and ended up being eaten by\n"
"vulture spirits, but her twins were brought up by an old woman, whom they later\n"
"killed and ran away. While hiding in a treetop, they saw a woman catching fish\n"
"with a sifter. She saw their reflection in the water and tried to catch it, at\n"
"which they laughed. She then realized they were up in the tree, and sent ants\n"
"up the tree to make them come down. When they came down, she killed one of them\n"
"and took the other home. One of her daughters fell in love with the man and\n"
"married him. Now the husband had to catch a lot of fish every day for the\n"
"mother-in-law. One day, tired of his demanding mother-in-law, he tricked her\n"
"into getting into the water to help him unload a boat full of fish, where she\n"
"was eaten by a shark. When her other daughter arrived, the liver of her mother\n"
"was still floating on the water and told her that the man killed her. The\n"
"daughter wanted to kill him but he flew away on wings of cotton that his wife\n"
"made for him, so she only cut his thigh off, which is why he is now the\n"
