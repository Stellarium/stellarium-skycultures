"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"Les _Lokono_, également connus sous le nom de _Arawak_, sont un peuple indigène des Guyanes, dont le territoire s'étend le long de la côte de l'océan Atlantique, du nord-ouest de la Guyane, en passant par le Suriname, jusqu'au nord-ouest de la Guyane française (voir carte) [#1]. Les Lokono parlent une langue qui appartient à la famille des langues arawakan, l'un des plus grands regroupements linguistiques du continent. Comme beaucoup de leurs parents linguistiques, les Lokono sont des agriculteurs spécialisés dans la culture du manioc (_Manihot esculenta_), qui pratiquent également la pêche, la chasse et la cueillette de plantes sauvages. Cependant, en tant que l'un des premiers groupes indigènes rencontrés par les Européens au moment de la conquête, les Lokono sont en contact avec des populations non indigènes depuis plus de 500 ans [#2]. Ce contact s'est intensifié au cours du siècle dernier, entraînant une perte substantielle de la langue Lokono, du matériel traditionnel et de la culture immatérielle, des changements dans les pratiques de subsistance, et en particulier la disparition des _medicine-men_, les porteurs traditionnels de connaissances spirituelles, très probablement y compris les connaissances ethnoastronomiques.\n"
"\n"
"En conséquence, les connaissances modernes sur les corps célestes ne semblent être qu'une fraction de ce que le Lokono connaissait des étoiles dans le passé.

"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"D'après les récits contemporains et historiques, il semble que les connaissances astronomiques n'étaient pas limitées à des membres particuliers de la société Lokono. Cependant, ce sont les guérisseurs en particulier - les chefs spirituels du Lokono connus sous le nom de _semethi_ - qui devaient maîtriser les divers aspects de la connaissance des étoiles et qui auraient pu être chargés de transmettre les traditions orales qui leur sont associées d'une génération à l'autre. un autre. De Rodrigo de Navarette, qui vers 1550 a écrit l'un des premiers récits du Lokono, nous apprenons, par exemple, que: «des vieillards et des sages qu'ils appellent _Cemetu_ se réunissent dans les maisons conçues pour leurs réunions et (...) racontent les traditions et les exploits de leurs ancêtres et de leurs grands hommes, et racontent également ce que ces ancêtres ont entendu de leurs ancêtres; de sorte qu'ils se souviennent ainsi des événements les plus anciens de leur pays et de leur peuple. Et, de la même manière, ils racontent ou prêchent des événements concernant les cieux, le soleil, la lune et les étoiles. »[#3]\n"

"Le _cemetu_ de Navarette, les guérisseurs connus dans le Lokono moderne sous le nom de _semethi_, ont largement abandonné leurs pratiques aujourd'hui, ce qui peut être la raison pour laquelle la transmission des connaissances astronomiques a été interrompue. De nombreuses constellations Lokono semblent avoir été oubliées aujourd'hui. Nos sources se limitent donc souvent à des récits historiques rédigés par les premiers explorateurs et ethnographes des Guyanes, dont l'un des plus anciens exemples est illustré ci-dessous.\n"

"C'est cette littérature qui nous permet de reconstruire en partie les connaissances stellaires du Lokono, décrites ci-dessous. Avant de discuter des corps célestes individuels, cependant, plusieurs caractéristiques générales de l'astronomie Lokono méritent une mention, à savoir:\n"
"\n"
"* le chevauchement avec les traditions astronomiques des groupes autochtones voisins.\n"
"* les traditions orales expliquant l'origine et la signification des corps célestes.\n"
"* l'utilisation du terme _koya_ \"esprit\" dans les noms de nombreuses constellations.\n"
"* l'utilisation du terme général _wiwa_ \"étoile, année\" et l'absence d'autres termes astronomiques.\n"
"* les pratiques d'observation du ciel du Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Connaissances partagées en guyanais\n"
"\n"
"Le territoire de Lokono borde celui de deux peuples autochtones non apparentés sur le plan linguistique, le Kari’na, parlant une langue caribane, et le Warao, parlant une langue isolée. Bien que non liés et traditionnellement non mariés, les trois groupes partagent beaucoup de culture matérielle et immatérielle. La tradition ethnoastronomique des trois peuples montre également un certain nombre de similitudes frappantes, telles que des mythes stellaires partagés, des noms similaires de constellations et des parallèles dans le calendrier stellaire. Cela témoigne des contacts entre les trois groupes et de l'échange de connaissances astronomiques, éventuellement facilité par leurs chefs spirituels respectifs, tels que le Lokono _semethi_. La mesure dans laquelle ces traditions se chevauchent et la directionnalité de leur échange appellent un complément d'étude. Ici, nous nous concentrons sur le Lokono et ne discutons donc pas en détail de ces emprunts culturels, à moins qu'ils ne mettent en lumière l'ethnoastronomie du Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Traditions orales stellaires\n"
"\n"
"L'une de ces caractéristiques communes est les mythes sur les étoiles. De telles traditions orales racontent les origines de corps célestes particuliers, les relient les uns aux autres et expliquent leur influence sur le monde naturel. La constellation Lokono _Hithikoya_ ‘Esprit du curassow noir’, par exemple, est liée dans un mythe Lokono à celle de _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ et _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, toutes trois ayant des équivalents Kari’na et Warao. Ce sont ces traditions orales, préservées par les guérisseurs, qui ont probablement servi de véhicule principal à travers lequel les connaissances astronomiques ont été transmises d'une génération à l'autre. Pour cette raison, des résumés des mythes pertinents sont donnés dans la description de constellations particulières. Parfois, lorsque le mythe Lokono pertinent n'est pas documenté, les mythes des groupes voisins sont mentionnés afin d'éclairer la signification de corps célestes particuliers. Étant donné que bon nombre de ces traditions orales sont partagées par les Lokono et les groupes voisins, cette amélioration des connaissances astronomiques des Lokono mal préservées est justifiée.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendrier des esprits\n"
"\n"
"Le terme _koya_ \"esprit\", que l'on trouve dans de nombreux noms de constellation typiquement suivant un terme pour une plante ou un animal particulier, est une caractéristique clé de l'astronomie Lokono. Walter Roth, un ethnographe des Guyanes, explique que de telles constellations sont les esprits des êtres correspondants. [#4] À une époque de l'année où la constellation apparaît, l'esprit voyage du ciel vers la terre pour donner vie aux êtres qu'il représente. En tant que telles, les constellations _koya_ ont formé un calendrier, indiquant le meilleur moment pour s'engager dans des activités de subsistance liées à ces plantes et animaux (par exemple, la chasse ou la cueillette). Le Lokono a peut-être aussi su où ces esprits descendraient sur terre; Walter Roth suggère qu'ils ont appelé ces lieux avec les mêmes noms que les constellations mais les preuves de cela restent pauvres. Ainsi, _Hadorhikoya_ 'Esprit des acouchi rouges' ferait référence à l'esprit, à la constellation et à l'endroit où le _hadorhi_ se trouve en abondance lorsque sa constellation apparaît. Alors que cette connaissance toponymique est oubliée aujourd'hui, les constellations _koya_ nous rappellent la grande compréhension de la vie végétale et animale que possédait le Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, l'étoile et l'année\n"
"\n"
"Les Lokono ont également un autre terme général utilisé pour désigner les étoiles, _wiwa_. Le terme n'a pas les connotations spirituelles de _koya._ Il se réfère, d'une part, à la qualité physique des étoiles comme quelque chose de brillant et, d'autre part, à l'année civile. En tant que tel, il est utilisé, par exemple, pour parler de son âge. Bien qu'il puisse s'appliquer à n'importe quelle étoile, _wiwa_ n'apparaît que sous deux noms propres de corps célestes. _Yôkoro wiwa_, littéralement «Scores of stars» (Pléiades), est la plus importante de toutes les constellations Lokono, dont l'apparence commence traditionnellement l'année civile Lokono. Après _Yôkoro wiwa_ se trouvent les nombreuses _koya_ constellations, chacune signalant une saison différente dans le calendrier Lokono. D’un autre côté, _Wiwa kalemero_, littéralement «étoile brillante» (Jupiter) semble avoir été singularisée uniquement en raison de sa luminosité. Mis à part _wiwa_ et _koya_, il n'y a pas de termes génériques distinguant les planètes, les étoiles, les lunes, les soleils, les galaxies, etc. dans la langue Lokono. Pour cette raison, l'équivalent Lokono de la Voie lactée, par exemple, est inclus parmi d'autres constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Pratiques d'observation du ciel\n"
"\n"
"Alors que le Lokono peut admirer le ciel le soir, pour suivre le calendrier stellaire du Lokono, il faut regarder les constellations vers 4 heures du matin, heure à laquelle le Lokono se réveille généralement. Les Lokono observent ainsi la montée des constellations au matin. Pour avoir une bonne idée du cycle annuel des constellations, il convient également de définir l'emplacement de visualisation sur les Guyanes (par exemple, Georgetown, Paramaribo ou Cayenne dans le menu de localisation). Il convient de mentionner que de nombreux Lokono, lorsqu'ils dessinaient des constellations, ne reliaient pas les étoiles avec des lignes et que dans certains cas, il y avait peu d'accord entre les locuteurs quant à l'étoile dans une constellation qui correspond aux parties de la plante ou de l'animal qu'elle représente. Dans Stellarium, nous représentons des constellations avec des lignes, mais il faut garder à l'esprit que cela peut être une distorsion de la tradition Lokono, qui permet une plus grande flexibilité dans l'interprétation de groupes d'étoiles particuliers. Enfin, il existe des restrictions sur l'observation de certains corps célestes, car on pense qu'un spirt peut nuire à un corps si on le regarde [#5]. Par exemple, à la pleine lune, les mères couvraient les yeux de leurs enfants afin qu'elles ne tombent pas malades [#6]. On a également dit aux jeunes de ne pas regarder _Yôkoro wiwa_ (Pléiades), sinon ils ne grandiraient pas [#7]. Ces pratiques s’appliquaient également à d’autres objets censés abriter des esprits puissants et comprenaient d’autres moyens d’éviter tout contact visuel avec des esprits tels que des poivrons, des limes ou du sel dans les yeux.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono corps célestes\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Soleil'\n"
"\n"
"Le terme Lokono pour le Soleil est _Hadali_, également prononcé comme _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje suggère que les différents noms orthographiés du héros de la culture Lokono, le premier sorcier connu sous le nom de _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_, _Hariwalli_, et _Arawanili_, et parfois _Arawidi_, peuvent tous faire référence au même héros identifié comme le Soleil [#8]. Bien que nous ne puissions pas confirmer cette hypothèse, le mythe de _Arawidi_ mérite d'être mentionné. Dans le mythe Lokono, _Arawidi_, le Soleil, est le père d'un homme qui devient la constellation _Mabukuli_ \"Homme sans cuisse\" (ceinture d'Orion) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Selon l'histoire, le Soleil avait l'habitude de venir sur terre sous la forme d'un homme appelé _Arawidi_ pour rencontrer son amant avec qui il avait des jumeaux. Dans un épisode ultérieur du mythe, l'un des jumeaux épouse une femme, dont la mère le couple décide de tuer. Lorsqu'ils tentent de s'échapper, la sœur de l'épouse les poursuit et parvient à lui couper la jambe pour se venger. En conséquence, l'homme monte vers le ciel et devient la constellation _Mabukuli_. Un autre mythe Lokono met en garde contre d'offenser le Soleil: un homme, coincé sur une île inhabitée au milieu d'un marécage, appelle au secours. Un bateau le dépasse, mais à l'intérieur du bateau se trouve le Soleil, qui ne veut pas aider l'homme, car les gens se plaignent toujours que le Soleil brille trop fort [#11]. En ce qui concerne les pratiques liées au Soleil, Im Thurn a rapporté que parmi les Lokono, l'éclipse du Soleil était considérée comme une guerre entre _Hadali_ et _Kathi_, la Lune, et que le Lokono crierait et ferait toutes sortes de bruits pour les en empêcher. combats [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"La lune est connue sous le nom de _Kathi_, un terme enregistré pour la première fois par Joannes de Laet comme _cattehee_ vers 1598, et utilisé également pour désigner le mois lunaire [#13]. Selon le Lokono, la Lune, comme le Soleil, était autrefois un homme. Walter Roth rapporte un mythe Lokono, dans lequel une jeune femme a été visitée par un mystérieux amant nuit après nuit [#10]. Pour savoir qui était l'amant, la femme s'est enduit les mains de suie au fond d'un pot. Le lendemain, lorsqu'elle s'est réveillée, elle a découvert que le visage de son frère était couvert de suie et s'est rendu compte que c'était lui qui lui avait rendu visite la nuit. Tout le monde dans sa communauté a commencé à éviter le frère incestueux, qui a eu tellement honte qu'il s'est éloigné du peuple et est finalement monté vers le ciel, devenant la Lune. C'est pourquoi, selon le Lokono, le visage de la lune est sale aujourd'hui. La Lune apparaît également dans un autre mythe. Dans le mythe Lokono sur un homme coincé sur une île inhabitée mentionnée ci-dessus, un autre bateau passe l'homme, mais cette fois à l'intérieur se trouve la Lune, qui décide d'aider l'homme, car les gens sont toujours heureux de voir la Lune sortir la nuit [#11]. La Lune et le Soleil sont également représentés comme des adversaires. Dans les temps précédents, le Lokono croyait que l'éclipse de la Lune était sa mort (_kathi ôdon_ 'lune mourante') et surveillerait toute la nuit. [#6] Le Lokono dit pendant l'éclipse de la Lune que la Lune s'est endormie le chemin du Soleil [#11]. Par conséquent, ils font beaucoup de bruit, jouent de la batterie et sonnent des trompettes pour le réveiller. À la pleine lune, les mères couvriraient les yeux de leurs enfants afin qu'elles ne tombent pas malades.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Vénus'\n"
"\n"
"La planète Vénus, à la fois lorsqu'elle apparaît le matin comme l'étoile du matin et lorsqu'elle apparaît le soir comme l'étoile du soir, est appelée _Warhokoma_ par le Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15]. Charles Dance, d'autre part, rapporte les termes _Eweiwah_ et _Huewah_, probablement les équivalents du terme général _wiwa_\n"
"«Étoile» qui peut être utilisée pour tout corps céleste brillant [#16]. Les Lokono parlent aussi de Vénus comme _Hiyaro wiwa_ \"star des femmes\". À cet égard, il convient de mentionner que Claudius de Goeje rapporte que lorsque _Hiyaro wiwa_ apparaît près de la Lune et qu'une fille est sur le point d'avoir ses premières menstruations, les Lokono disent que la fille sera bientôt touchée par la Lune [#5]. Il n'y a pas de mythe concernant _Warhokoma_ spécifiquement et sa relation avec la Lune, mais il convient de rappeler que le Lokono connaît une histoire, dans laquelle la Lune était à l'origine un homme qui a commis l'inceste avec sa sœur (voir le mythe mentionné sous _Kathi_), et a un nom de coureur de jupons [#10]. Fait intéressant, le nom _Warhokoma_ pour Morning or Evening Star apparaît également dans Kari’na, qui le voit aussi comme la femme de la Lune [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Voie lactée'\n"
"\n"
"La voie lactée est connue chez les Lokono sous le nom de _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, littéralement\n"
"«Chemin des porteurs d’argile». La Voie lactée représente les empreintes de pas d'hommes qui allaient autrefois chercher de l'argile pour fabriquer des pots, un art qui est, rarement voire pas du tout, pratiqué par les Lokono aujourd'hui. L'origine du nom, cependant, est encore connue et est résumée dans un mythe [#19]. Le même nom pour la Voie lactée a été noté par William Brett qui ajoute qu'il est nommé d'après un type spécifique d'argile blanchâtre [#14]. Charles Dance, d'autre part, dit que la Voie lactée représente les empreintes de pécaris enracinant l'argile, tandis que Walter Roth mentionne une explication différente de Lokono, selon laquelle la Voie lactée représente un tapir poursuivi par un chien et un jaguar [#10] [#16]. Cependant, ces deux sources ne donnent pas le nom Lokono correspondant à la Voie Lactée, et il est possible que ces deux explications soient une influence Kari'na, qui reconnaissent une constellation d'un tigre suivant la constellation d'un tapir à l'intérieur de celle du Lacté Chemin [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"Les Lokono modernes appellent Sirius _Mali_, dont la signification littérale est inconnue. Cornelius van Coll décrit une étoile Lokono appelée _Mali_ et explique qu'il s'agit d'une étoile très puissante [#7] [#17]. Quand il se lève le matin d'août, il tue le poisson dans les marais, et il ne faut pas le pointer, sinon son doigt deviendra boiteux. Le _Mali_ de Cornelius van Coll marque le début de la grande saison sèche (août à décembre), appelée en Lokono _malidalithe_, un terme dérivé de _Mali_. Des sources plus anciennes ont identifié _Mali_ provisoirement comme Lyra, Aquila ou Crux, mais étant donné que la grande saison sèche commence vers août et que les Lokono observent les étoiles le matin, ces identifications doivent être incorrectes; Lyra, Aquila et Crux ne sont pas visibles pour le moment depuis les territoires de Lokono [#11] [#17]. Il n'y a pas de mythes Lokono à propos de _Mali_, mais il existe des preuves qui peuvent correspondre à la constellation de Kari’na _Ombatapo_\n"
"«Visage précédent». Les mythes Kari’na expliquent l’origine de la constellation et son nom qui, comme le Lokono _Mali_, tuerait les poissons dans les marais et annonce le début de la grande saison sèche. De plus, le Kari’na _Ombatapo_ est identifié comme faisant partie de Puppis et Canis Major, dont le dernier inclut Sirius [#18] [#20]."

"The constellation _Hithikoya_ is the ‘Spirit of the black curassow’ (_Crax\n"
