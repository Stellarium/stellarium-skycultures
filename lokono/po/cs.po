"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"![](lokono_map_1.webp)\n"
"\n"
"_Lokono_, také známý jako _Arawak_, jsou domorodé obyvatele Guianů, jejichž území se rozprostírá podél pobřeží Atlantského oceánu, od severozápadní Guyany přes Surinam k severozápadní Francouzské Guayaně (viz mapa) [#1]. Lokono hovoří jazykem, který patří do arawakanské jazykové rodiny, jedné z největších jazykových uskupení na kontinentu. Stejně jako mnoho jejich lingvistických příbuzných jsou i Lokono zemědělci specializující se na chov manioku (_Manihot esculenta_), kteří také praktikují rybolov, lov a shromažďování divokých rostlin. Jako jedna z prvních domorodých skupin, s níž se Evropané setkali v době dobytí, byli Lokono v kontaktu s nepůvodními obyvatelstvem více než 500 let [#2]. Tento kontakt se v posledním století prohloubil a vedl ke značné ztrátě jazyka Lokono, tradiční materiální a nemateriální kultury, změnám v existenčních praktikách, a zejména ke zmizení _medicine-men_, tradičních nositelů duchovního poznání, s největší pravděpodobností včetně etnoastronomických znalostí.\n"
"\n"
"V důsledku toho se zdá, že moderní znalosti o nebeských tělech jsou jen zlomkem toho, co Lokono věděl o hvězdách v minulosti. Několik konstelací zmíněných ve starších zdrojích je zapomenuto nebo je známo pouze z jejich jmen, zatímco kombinace hvězd, které reprezentují, a ústní tradice vysvětlující jejich původ a význam byly zapomenuty. Nebeská kultura zde prezentovaná zahrnuje pouze identifikované konstelace, ale následující popis poskytuje ucelenější popis astronomických znalostí Lokono včetně informací extrahovaných z historických zdrojů o všech nebeských objektech uvedených v tabulce níže.\n"

"### Lokono astronomické znalosti: úvod\n"
"\n"
"Ze současných a historických účtů vyplývá, že astronomické znalosti nebyly omezeny na konkrétní členy společnosti Lokono. Byli to však především muži medicíny - duchovní vůdci Lokono známí jako _semethi_ - kteří byli povinni ovládat různé aspekty poznání hvězd a kdo by mohl být odpovědný za předávání ústních tradic, které jsou s nimi spojeny z jedné generace na další. Z Rodriga de Navarette, který kolem roku 1550 napsal jeden z prvních účtů o Lokono, se například dozvíme, že: „staří a moudří muži, kterým říkají _Cemetu_, se shromažďují v domech určených pro jejich setkání a (...) přepočítávají tradice a vykořisťování jejich předků a velkých mužů a také vypráví, co tito předci slyšeli od svých předků; takže si tímto způsobem pamatují nejstarší události své země a lidí. A podobně vyprávějí nebo hlásají události týkající se nebes, slunce, měsíce a hvězd. “[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, medicínští muži, známí v moderním Lokono jako _semethi_, se dnes většinou vzdali svých praktik, což může být důvodem, proč byl přenos astronomických znalostí přerušen. Zdá se, že na mnoho souhvězdí Lokono bylo dnes zapomenuto. Naše zdroje jsou proto často omezeny na historické účty psané časnými průzkumníky a etnografy Guianů, jeden z nejstarších příkladů je ilustrován níže.\n"

"Právě tato literatura nám umožňuje párty rekonstruovat hvězdné znalosti Lokono, které jsou popsány níže. Před diskusí o jednotlivých nebeských tělech si však zaslouží zmínku několik obecných rysů astronomie Lokono:\n"
"\n"
"* překrývání s astronomickými tradicemi sousedních domorodých skupin.\n"
"ústní tradice vysvětlující původ a význam nebeských těles.\n"
"* použití výrazu „duch“ ve jménech četných souhvězdí.\n"
"* použití obecného termínu _wiwa_ „hvězda, rok“ a nedostatek dalších astronomických pojmů.\n"
"* cvičení Lokono při sledování oblohy.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Sdílené znalosti Guiananu\n"
"\n"
"Území Lokono hraničí s tím, že dva lingvisticky nesouvisející domorodé národy, Kari'na, mluvící karibským jazykem, a Warao, mluvící izolovaným jazykem. Ačkoli nesouvisí a tradičně se nesezdávají, tři skupiny sdílejí velké množství materiální a nehmotné kultury. Etnoastronomická tradice tří národů také ukazuje řadu nápadných podobností, jako jsou sdílené hvězdné mýty, podobná jména souhvězdí a paralely ve hvězdném kalendáři. Toto hovoří o kontaktech mezi těmito třemi skupinami a o výměně astronomických znalostí, možná usnadněných jejich příslušnými duchovními vůdci, jako je Lokono _semethi_. Míra, do jaké se tyto tradice překrývají, a směrovost jejich výměny vyžadují další studium. Zde se zaměřujeme na Lokono, a proto o těchto kulturních výpůjčkách podrobně nediskutujeme, ledaže by osvětlily etokonastomii Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Hvězdné orální tradice\n"
"\n"
"Jednou z takových sdílených funkcí jsou mýty o hvězdách. Takové ústní tradice vyprávějí o původu konkrétních nebeských těles, spojují je navzájem a vysvětlují jejich vliv na přírodní svět. Například souhvězdí Lokono „Hithikoya“ „Duch černého curassow“ je spojeno v mýtu Lokono s mýtem _Yokhârhin_ „Hunter“ a _Alêti_ „Torch“, z nichž všichni tři mají ekvivalenty Kari'ny a Warao. Právě tyto ústní tradice, uchované léky-muži, pravděpodobně sloužily jako hlavní prostředek, kterým se předávaly astronomické znalosti z jedné generace na druhou. Z tohoto důvodu jsou shrnutí příslušných mýtů uvedena v popisu konkrétních konstelací. Někdy, když není zdokumentován příslušný mýtus Lokono, jsou zmíněny mýty sousedních skupin, aby osvětlily význam konkrétních nebeských těles. Vzhledem k tomu, že mnoho takových ústních tradic sdílí Lokono a sousední skupiny, je toto posílení špatně zachovaných astronomických znalostí Lokono odůvodněné.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Kalendář lihovin\n"
"\n"
"Klíčovým prvkem astronomie Lokono je výraz _koya_, duch ', který se nachází v mnoha konstelačních názvech obvykle následujících po termínu pro konkrétní rostlinu nebo zvíře. Walter Roth, gunoasský etnograf, vysvětluje, že takové souhvězdí jsou duchové odpovídajících bytostí. [#4] V době roku, kdy se souhvězdí objeví, duch cestuje z nebe na Zemi, aby vdechl život do bytostí, které představuje. Konstituce _koya_ jako takový vytvořily kalendář, který ukazuje, jaký je nejlepší čas zapojit se do existenčních aktivit souvisejících s těmito rostlinami a zvířaty (např. Lov nebo shromažďování). Lokono možná také věděl, kde by takoví duchové sestupovali na Zemi; Walter Roth naznačuje, že tato místa nazvali stejnými jmény jako souhvězdí, ale důkazy o tom zůstávají špatné. _Hadorhikoya_ „Duch červených acouchi“ by tedy odkazoval na ducha, souhvězdí a na místo, kde se _hadorhi_ nachází, když se objeví jeho souhvězdí. Zatímco toto toponymické poznání je dnes zapomenuto, souhvězdí _koya_ nám připomínají velké pochopení rostlinného a živočišného života, které Lokono vlastnil.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, hvězda a rok\n"
"\n"
"Lokono také má další obecný termín, který se používá k označení hvězd, _wiwa_. Termín postrádá duchovní konotace _koya._ Na jedné straně odkazuje na fyzickou kvalitu hvězd jako na něco zářícího a na druhou stranu na kalendářní rok. Používá se například při rozhovoru o věku. I když se může vztahovat na jakoukoli hvězdu, _wiwa_ se objeví pouze ve dvou vlastních jménech nebeských těl. _Yôkoro wiwa_, doslova „Skóre hvězd“ (Plejády), je nejdůležitější ze všech konstelací Lokono, jejichž vzhled tradičně začíná kalendářním rokem Lokono. Po _Yôkoro wiwa_ jsou četné souhvězdí _koya_, z nichž každá signalizuje jinou sezónu v kalendáři Lokono. Na druhé straně se zdá, že _Wiwa kalemero_, doslova „zářící hvězda“ (Jupiter), byla vybrána pouze kvůli své jasnosti. Kromě _wiwa_ a _koya_ neexistují v jazyce Lokono žádné obecné pojmy rozlišující planety, hvězdy, měsíce, slunce, galaxie atd. Z tohoto důvodu je například Lokono ekvivalent Mléčné dráhy zahrnut mezi další souhvězdí.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Postupy sledování oblohy\n"
"\n"
"Zatímco Lokono může obdivovat oblohu ve večerních hodinách, abychom mohli sledovat hvězdný kalendář Lokono, musíme se podívat na souhvězdí kolem 4 hodin ráno, v době, kdy se Lokono obvykle probudí. Lokono tak pozoruje ráno stoupající souhvězdí. Chcete-li získat správnou představu o ročním cyklu souhvězdí, měli byste také nastavit umístění prohlížení na Guianas (např. Georgetown, Paramaribo nebo Cayenne v nabídce umístění). Zaslouží si zmínku, že mnoho Lokono při kreslení souhvězdí nepřipojovalo hvězdy k čarám a že v některých případech mezi řečníky byla jen malá shoda ohledně toho, která hvězda v souhvězdí odpovídá které části rostliny nebo zvířete, které představuje. Ve Stellarium reprezentujeme konstelace s liniemi, ale je třeba mít na paměti, že to může být zkreslení Lokono tradice, což umožňuje větší flexibilitu při interpretaci konkrétních hvězdných skupin. Konečně existují omezení, pokud jde o pohled na některá nebeská těla, protože se předpokládá, že špína může jedno poškodit, pokud se podíváte na [#5]. Například za úplňku matky zakryly oči svých dětí tak, aby nezdravě [#6]. Mladým lidem bylo také řečeno, aby se nedívali na _Yôkoro wiwa_ (Plejády), jinak by nerostli [#7]. Tyto praktiky se vztahovaly také na jiné předměty, o nichž se předpokládá, že mají silné duchy, a zahrnovaly i jiné způsoby, jak se vyhnout kontaktu očí s duchy, jako je mletí paprik, limetek nebo solí do očí.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono nebeská těla\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"Lokono termín pro slunce je _Hadali_, také vyslovován jako _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje naznačuje, že různě hláskovaná jména hrdiny kultury Lokono, prvního léčivého muže známého jako _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_, _Hariwalli_ a _Arawanili_, a někdy _Arawidi_, mohou všichni odkazovat na stejného hrdinu označeného jako Slunce [#8] ]. I když nemůžeme potvrdit tuto hypotézu, mýtus _Arawidi_ stojí za zmínku. V mýtu Lokono, _Arawidi_, Sun, je otec muže, který se stává souhvězdím _Mabukuli_ „Muž bez stehna“ (Orionův pás) [#9] [#10] [#11]. Podle příběhu Slunce přicházelo na Zemi ve tvaru muže zvaného _Arawidi, aby se setkalo se svým milencem, se kterým měl dvojčata. V pozdější epizodě mýtu si jedno z dvojčat vezme ženu, jejíž matka se manželka rozhodne zabít. Když se snaží utéct, sestra manželky je pronásleduje a podaří se mu pomstě uříznout nohu. Výsledkem je, že muž vystoupal na oblohu a stal se souhvězdím Mukukuli. Další mýtus Lokono varuje před urážkou Slunce: muž, uvízlý na neobývaném ostrově uprostřed bažiny, volá po pomoci. Loď prochází kolem něj, ale uvnitř lodi je Slunce, které nechce člověku pomoci, protože lidé si vždy stěžují, že Slunce svítí příliš tvrdě [#11]. Pokud jde o praktiky týkající se Slunce, Im Thurn hlásil, že mezi Lokonem bylo zatmění Slunce považováno za válku mezi _Hadali_ a _ Kathi_, Měsíc, a že Lokono křičel a vydával všechny zvuky, aby jim zabránil bojovat [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"Měsíc je známý jako _ Kathi_, termín, který Joannes de Laet poprvé zaznamenal jako _cattehee_ kolem roku 1598, a používá se také k označení lunárního měsíce [#13]. Podle Lokona byl Měsíc, stejně jako Slunce, kdysi muž. Walter Roth hlásí mýtus Lokono, ve kterém byla mladá žena navštěvována tajemnou mileneckou noc po noci [#10]. Aby zjistila, kdo je milenec, ušpinila jí ruce saze ze dna hrnce. Další den, když se probudila, zjistila, že tvář jejího bratra byla pokryta sazemi a uvědomila si, že ji navštívil v noci on. Všichni v její komunitě se začali vyhýbat krutému bratrovi, který se tak styděl, že se držel dál od lidí a nakonec vystoupil na oblohu a stal se Měsíc. Proto je podle Lokona tvář Měsíce dnes špinavá. Měsíc se objevuje také v jiném mýtu. V mýtu Lokono o muži uvězněném na neobydleném ostrově zmíněné výše, prochází kolem něj další loď, ale tentokrát uvnitř je Měsíc, který se rozhodne pomoci mu, protože lidé jsou vždy rádi, když vidí Měsíc vyjít v noci [#11]. Měsíc a Slunce jsou také zobrazovány jako odpůrci. V dřívějších dobách Lokono věřil, že zatmění Měsíce je jeho smrt (_kathi ôdon_ 'umírající na Měsíc') a bude celou noc hlídat. [#6] Lokono během zatmění Měsíce tvrdí, že Měsíc usnul cesta Slunce [#11]. Proto dělají hodně hluku, hrají na bubny a foukají trubkové trumpety, aby ho probudili. Za úplňku by matky zakrývaly oči svých dětí tak, aby nezdravěly.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venuše'\n"
"\n"
"Planeta Venuše, a to jak když se ráno objeví jako ranní hvězda, tak i když se objeví jako večerní hvězda, nazývá Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15] _Warhokoma_. Na druhou stranu Charles Dance uvádí termíny _Eweiwah_ a _Huewah_, pravděpodobně ekvivalenty obecného termínu _wiwa_\n"
"„Hvězda“, kterou lze použít pro jakékoli zářící nebeské tělo [#16]. Lokono také hovoří o Venuši jako o „ženských hvězdách“ Hiyaro wiwa_. V souvislosti s tím si zaslouží zmínku, že Claudius de Goeje hlásí, že když se _Hiyaro wiwa_ objeví blízko Měsíce a dívka se chystá mít první menstruaci, Lokono říká, že dívka se brzy dotkne Měsíce [#5]. Neexistuje žádný mýtus o _Warhokoma_ konkrétně o jeho vztahu k Měsíci, ale stojí za to připomenout, že Lokono zná příběh, ve kterém Měsíc byl původně mužem, který spáchal incest se svou sestrou (viz mýtus uvedený pod _ Kathi_), a má jméno jako sukničkář [#10]. Zajímavé je, že jméno _Warhokoma_ pro Morning or Evening Star se objevuje také v Kari'na, která to vidí také jako manželku Měsíce [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Mléčná dráha'\n"
"\n"
"Mléčná dráha je mezi Lokonem známá jako _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, doslova\n"
"\"Cesta nosičů hlíny\". Mléčná dráha představuje stopy mužů, kteří kdysi šli do hlíny pro výrobu hrnců, umění, které dnes zřídka, pokud vůbec, praktikuje Lokono. Původ jména je však stále známý a je shrnut v mýtu [#19]. Stejné jméno pro Mléčnou dráhu si všiml William Brett, který dodává, že je pojmenován po specifickém bělavém typu jílu [#14]. Charles Dance, na druhé straně, říká, že Mléčná dráha představuje stopy peccaries zakořenění hlíny, zatímco Walter Roth zmiňuje jiné Lokono vysvětlení, podle kterého Mléčná dráha představuje tapír pronásledovaný psem a jaguárem [#10] [#16]. Tyto dva zdroje však nedávají odpovídající název Lokono pro Mléčnou dráhu a je možné, že tato dvě vysvětlení jsou vlivem Kari'ny, kteří uznávají souhvězdí tygra po souhvězdí tapírů v rámci mléčné dráhy Způsob [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"Moderní Lokono nazývá Sirius _Mali_, jehož doslovný význam není znám. Cornelius van Coll popisuje hvězdu Lokono s názvem _Mali_ a vysvětluje, že se jedná o velmi mocnou hvězdu [#7] [#17]. Když přijde ráno v srpnu, zabije to ryby v bažinách a člověk by na to neměl ukazovat, jinak by se jeho prst stal chromým. _Mali_ společnosti Cornelius van Coll označuje začátek velké období sucha (srpen až prosinec), nazvaný Lokono _malidalithe_, což je termín odvozený od _Mali_. Starší zdroje se pokusně identifikovaly jako Lyra, Aquila nebo Crux, ale vzhledem k tomu, že velká suchá sezóna začíná kolem srpna a že Lokono ráno pozoruje hvězdy, musí být tyto identifikace nesprávné; Lyra, Aquila a Crux nelze v tuto chvíli vidět z území Lokono [#11] [#17]. O _Mali_ nejsou žádné mýty Lokono, ale existují důkazy, které mohou odpovídat souhvězdí Kari'na _Ombatapo_\n"
"\"Předchozí tvář\". Kari'nské mýty vysvětlují původ souhvězdí a jeho jméno, které, stejně jako Lokono _Mali_, věří, že zabíjí ryby v bažinách a oznamuje začátek velkého suchého období. Kari'na _Ombatapo_ je navíc identifikována jako součást Puppis a Canis Major, z nichž poslední zahrnuje Sirius [#18] [#20]."

"The constellation _Hithikoya_ is the ‘Spirit of the black curassow’ (_Crax\n"

"curassows about the approaching hunter (see _Yokhârhin_) and his companion with\n"
"a torch (see _Alêti_). The Lokono identify _Hithikoya_ as the Western\n"
"constellation Crux. When it appears just above the trees in January, the\n"
"curassows roam on the ground and are easy to catch. Over the following months,\n"
"the higher _Hithikoya_ rises in the morning, the higher the birds climb up the\n"
"trees. By March, it appears high in the sky and the birds are found in the tops\n"
"of the trees. _Hithikoya_ thus informs the Lokono where to search for the birds\n"
"at a given time of the year. The Lokono even make hunting charms (_bina_) from\n"
