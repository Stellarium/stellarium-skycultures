"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"Die _Lokono_, auch bekannt als _Arawak_, sind ein indigenes Volk der Guianas, deren Territorium sich entlang der Küste des Atlantischen Ozeans vom Nordwesten Guyanas über Suriname bis zum Nordwesten Französisch-Guayanas erstreckt (siehe Karte) [#1]. Die Lokono sprechen eine Sprache, die zur Arawakan-Sprachfamilie gehört, einer der größten Sprachgruppen auf dem Kontinent. Wie viele ihrer sprachlichen Verwandten sind die Lokono Landwirte, die sich auf die Maniokzucht (Manihot esculenta) spezialisiert haben und auch das Fischen, Jagen und Sammeln von Wildpflanzen praktizieren. Als eine der ersten indigenen Gruppen, denen die Europäer zum Zeitpunkt der Eroberung begegneten, stehen die Lokono seit über 500 Jahren mit nicht-indigenen Bevölkerungsgruppen in Kontakt [#2]. Dieser Kontakt hat sich im letzten Jahrhundert intensiviert, was höchstwahrscheinlich zu einem erheblichen Verlust der Lokono-Sprache, der traditionellen materiellen und immateriellen Kultur, zu Änderungen der Subsistenzpraktiken und insbesondere zum Verschwinden der Medizinmänner, der traditionellen Träger spirituellen Wissens, geführt hat einschließlich ethnoastronomischer Kenntnisse.\n"
"\n"
"Infolgedessen scheint das moderne Wissen über Himmelskörper nur ein Bruchteil dessen zu sein, was die Lokono in der Vergangenheit über Sterne wussten.

"### Astronomisches Wissen von Lokono: eine Einführung\n"
"\n"
"Aus zeitgenössischen und historischen Berichten geht hervor, dass das astronomische Wissen nicht auf bestimmte Mitglieder der Lokono-Gesellschaft beschränkt war. Es waren jedoch insbesondere die Medizinmänner - die spirituellen Führer des Lokono, bekannt als Semethi -, die die verschiedenen Aspekte des Sternwissens beherrschen mussten und die möglicherweise dafür verantwortlich waren, die mit ihnen verbundenen mündlichen Überlieferungen von einer Generation an eine weiterzugeben Ein weiterer. Von Rodrigo de Navarette, der um 1550 einen der ersten Berichte über den Lokono schrieb, erfahren wir zum Beispiel: „Alte und weise Männer, die sie _Cemetu_ nennen, versammeln sich in den Häusern, die für ihre Versammlungen vorgesehen sind, und (...) erzählen die Traditionen und Heldentaten ihrer Vorfahren und großen Männer und erzählen auch, was diese Vorfahren von ihren Vorfahren gehört haben; so dass sie sich auf diese Weise an die ältesten Ereignisse ihres Landes und ihrer Menschen erinnern. Und in gleicher Weise erzählen oder predigen sie über Ereignisse in Bezug auf Himmel, Sonne, Mond und Sterne. “[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarettes Cemetu, die Medizinmänner, die im modernen Lokono als Semethi bekannt sind, haben ihre Praktiken heute weitgehend aufgegeben, was möglicherweise der Grund dafür ist, dass die Weitergabe von astronomischem Wissen unterbrochen wurde. Viele Lokono-Konstellationen scheinen heute vergessen worden zu sein. Unsere Quellen beschränken sich daher häufig auf historische Berichte, die von frühen Forschern und Ethnographen der Guianas verfasst wurden.

"Es ist diese Literatur, die es uns ermöglicht, das unten beschriebene Sternwissen von Lokono zu rekonstruieren. Vor der Erörterung der einzelnen Himmelskörper sollten jedoch einige allgemeine Merkmale der Lokono-Astronomie erwähnt werden, nämlich:\n"
"\n"
"* die Überschneidung mit den astronomischen Traditionen benachbarter indigener Gruppen.\n"
"* die mündlichen Überlieferungen, die den Ursprung und die Bedeutung von Himmelskörpern erklären.\n"
"* die Verwendung des Begriffs _koya_ ‘Geist’ in den Namen zahlreicher Konstellationen.\n"
"* die Verwendung des allgemeinen Begriffs \"Stern, Jahr\" und das Fehlen anderer astronomischer Begriffe.\n"
"* die Himmelsbeobachtungspraktiken des Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Geteiltes guiananisches Wissen\n"
"\n"
"Das Gebiet von Lokono grenzt an das von zwei sprachlich nicht verwandten indigenen Völkern, der Kari'na, die eine Cariban-Sprache spricht, und der Warao, die ein Sprachisolat spricht. Obwohl nicht verwandt und traditionell nicht untereinander verheiratet, teilen die drei Gruppen viel materielle und immaterielle Kultur. Die ethnoastronomische Tradition der drei Völker zeigt auch eine Reihe auffälliger Ähnlichkeiten, wie gemeinsame Sternmythen, ähnliche Namen von Sternbildern und Parallelen im Sternenkalender. Dies spricht für die Kontakte zwischen den drei Gruppen und für den Austausch von astronomischem Wissen, das möglicherweise von ihren jeweiligen spirituellen Führern wie dem Lokono Semethi erleichtert wird. Das Ausmaß, in dem sich diese Traditionen überschneiden, und die Ausrichtung ihres Austauschs erfordern weitere Untersuchungen. Hier konzentrieren wir uns auf den Lokono und diskutieren diese kulturellen Anleihen daher nicht im Detail, es sei denn, sie werfen ein Licht auf die Lokoo-Ethnoastronomie.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Hervorragende mündliche Überlieferungen\n"
"\n"
"Eines dieser gemeinsamen Merkmale sind Mythen über Sterne. Solche mündlichen Überlieferungen erzählen von den Ursprüngen bestimmter Himmelskörper, verbinden sie miteinander und erklären ihren Einfluss auf die natürliche Welt. Die Lokono-Konstellation _Hithikoya_ „Geist des schwarzen Curassows“ zum Beispiel ist in einem Lokono-Mythos mit der von Yokhârhin-Jäger und Alêti-Fackel verbunden, die alle drei Kari'na- und Warao-Entsprechungen haben. Es sind diese mündlichen Überlieferungen, die von den Medizinmännern bewahrt wurden und wahrscheinlich als Hauptinstrument dienten, durch das astronomisches Wissen von einer Generation zur nächsten weitergegeben wurde. Aus diesem Grund werden in der Beschreibung bestimmter Konstellationen Zusammenfassungen der relevanten Mythen gegeben. Gelegentlich, wenn der relevante Lokono-Mythos nicht dokumentiert ist, wird auf Mythen der Nachbargruppen Bezug genommen, um die Bedeutung bestimmter Himmelskörper zu beleuchten. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass viele dieser mündlichen Überlieferungen von Lokono und den benachbarten Gruppen geteilt werden, ist diese Verbesserung des schlecht erhaltenen astronomischen Wissens von Lokono gerechtfertigt.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Geisterkalender\n"
"\n"
"Der Begriff _koya_ ‘Geist’, der in zahlreichen Konstellationsnamen vorkommt, die typischerweise einem Begriff für eine bestimmte Pflanze oder ein bestimmtes Tier folgen, ist ein Schlüsselmerkmal der Lokono-Astronomie. Walter Roth, ein Ethnograph der Guianas, erklärt, dass solche Konstellationen die Geister der entsprechenden Wesen sind. [#4] Zu einer Jahreszeit, in der die Konstellation erscheint, reist der Geist vom Himmel zur Erde, um den Wesen Leben einzuhauchen repräsentiert. Als solche bildeten die _koya_-Konstellationen einen Kalender, der angibt, wann der beste Zeitpunkt für Subsistenzaktivitäten im Zusammenhang mit diesen Pflanzen und Tieren ist (z. B. Jagen oder Sammeln). Der Lokono könnte auch gewusst haben, wo solche Geister auf die Erde herabsteigen würden; Walter Roth schlägt vor, diese Orte mit den gleichen Namen wie die Sternbilder zu bezeichnen, aber die Beweise dafür bleiben schlecht. So würde sich Hadorhikoya \"Geist der roten Akouchi\" auf den Geist, die Konstellation und den Ort beziehen, an dem sich die Hadorhi in Hülle und Fülle befindet, wenn ihre Konstellation erscheint. Während dieses toponymische Wissen heute vergessen wird, erinnern uns die _koya_-Konstellationen an das große Verständnis des Pflanzen- und Tierlebens, das der Lokono besaß.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, der Stern und das Jahr\n"
"\n"
"Die Lokono haben auch einen anderen allgemeinen Begriff, der verwendet wird, um sich auf Sterne zu beziehen, _wiwa_. Dem Begriff fehlen die geistigen Konnotationen von _koya._ Er bezieht sich einerseits auf die physische Qualität von Sternen als etwas Leuchtendes und andererseits auf das Kalenderjahr. Als solches wird es beispielsweise verwendet, wenn über das Alter gesprochen wird. Während es für jeden Stern gelten kann, erscheint _wiwa_ nur in zwei Eigennamen von Himmelskörpern. _Yôkoro wiwa_, wörtlich \"Scores of Stars\" (Plejaden), ist die wichtigste aller Lokono-Konstellationen, deren Erscheinungsbild traditionell mit dem Lokono-Kalenderjahr beginnt. Nach Yôkoro wiwa folgen die zahlreichen Konvo-Konstellationen, die jeweils eine andere Jahreszeit im Lokono-Kalender anzeigen. Auf der anderen Seite scheint Wiwa Kalemero, wörtlich \"leuchtender Stern\" (Jupiter), allein aufgrund seiner Helligkeit herausgegriffen worden zu sein. Außer _wiwa_ und _koya_ gibt es keine allgemeinen Begriffe, die Planeten, Sterne, Monde, Sonnen, Galaxien usw. in der Lokono-Sprache unterscheiden. Aus diesem Grund ist unter anderem das Lokono-Äquivalent der Milchstraße enthalten.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Himmelsbeobachtungspraktiken\n"
"\n"
"Während der Lokono abends den Himmel bewundern kann, muss man, um dem Sternenkalender von Lokono zu folgen, die Sternbilder gegen 4 Uhr morgens betrachten, die Zeit, in der der Lokono normalerweise aufwacht. Die Lokono beobachten also morgens das Aufsteigen der Sternbilder. Um die richtige Vorstellung vom jährlichen Konstellationszyklus zu erhalten, sollte der Betrachtungsort auch auf die Guianas eingestellt werden (z. B. Georgetown, Paramaribo oder Cayenne im Standortmenü). Es verdient eine Erwähnung, dass viele Lokono beim Zeichnen von Sternbildern die Sterne nicht mit Linien verbanden und dass in einigen Fällen unter den Sprechern wenig Einigkeit darüber bestand, welcher Stern innerhalb einer Sternbild welchen Teilen der Pflanze oder des Tieres entspricht, die er darstellt. In Stellarium stellen wir Konstellationen mit Linien dar, es sollte jedoch beachtet werden, dass dies eine Verzerrung der Lokono-Tradition sein kann, die mehr Flexibilität bei der Interpretation bestimmter Sterngruppen ermöglicht. Schließlich gibt es Einschränkungen beim Betrachten einiger Himmelskörper, da angenommen wird, dass ein Spirt einem Schaden zufügen kann, wenn man sich [#5] ansieht. Zum Beispiel bedeckten Mütter bei Vollmond die Augen ihrer Kinder, damit sie nicht krank wurden [#6]. Den jungen Leuten wurde auch gesagt, sie sollten sich Yôkoro wiwa (Plejaden) nicht ansehen, sonst würden sie nicht wachsen [#7]. Solche Praktiken galten auch für andere Objekte, von denen angenommen wird, dass sie starke Geister beherbergen, und umfassten andere Möglichkeiten, Augenkontakt mit Geistern zu vermeiden, wie z. B. das Einreiben von Paprika, Limetten oder Salz in die Augen.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono Himmelskörper\n"
"\n"
"Hadali 'Sonne'\n"
"\n"
"Der Lokono-Begriff für die Sonne ist _Hadali_, auch ausgesprochen als _Adali_. Claaudius de Goeje schlägt vor, dass die unterschiedlich geschriebenen Namen des Lokono-Kulturhelden, des ersten Medizinmannes, bekannt als Harlitvanli, Halwalwalika, Halwanli, Harwalli, und Draanili, und manchmal auch Draidi, sich alle auf denselben Helden beziehen, der als Sonne identifiziert wurde [#8]. Während wir diese Hypothese nicht bestätigen können, ist der Mythos von Draidi erwähnenswert. Im Lokono-Mythos ist Arawidi, die Sonne, der Vater eines Mannes, der zur Konstellation Mabukuli \"Mann ohne Oberschenkel\" (Orions Gürtel) wird [#9] [#10] [#11]. Der Geschichte zufolge kam die Sonne in der Gestalt eines Mannes namens Drawidi auf die Erde, um seinen Geliebten zu treffen, mit dem er Zwillinge hatte. In einer späteren Folge des Mythos heiratet einer der Zwillinge eine Frau, deren Mutter das Paar zu töten beschließt. Als sie versuchen zu fliehen, jagt die Schwester der Frau sie und schafft es, sich aus Rache das Bein abzuschneiden. Infolgedessen steigt der Mann zum Himmel auf und wird das Sternbild Mabukuli. Ein anderer Lokono-Mythos warnt davor, die Sonne zu beleidigen: Ein Mann, der auf einer unbewohnten Insel mitten in einem Sumpf festsitzt, schreit um Hilfe. Ein Boot fährt an ihm vorbei, aber im Boot befindet sich die Sonne, die dem Mann nicht helfen will, da sich die Leute immer beschweren, dass die Sonne zu stark scheint [#11]. In Bezug auf Praktiken im Zusammenhang mit der Sonne berichtete Im Thurn, dass unter den Lokono die Sonnenfinsternis als Krieg zwischen Hadali und Kathi, dem Mond, angesehen wurde und dass der Lokono schreien und alle Arten von Geräuschen machen würde, um sie davon abzuhalten kämpfen [#12].\n"
"\n"
"Kathi 'Mond'\n"
"\n"
"Der Mond ist bekannt als Kathi, ein Begriff, der zuerst von Joannes de Laet um 1598 als Cattehee aufgezeichnet wurde und sich auch auf den Mondmonat bezieht [#13]. Laut Lokono war der Mond wie die Sonne einst ein Mann. Walter Roth berichtet von einem Lokono-Mythos, in dem eine junge Frau Nacht für Nacht von einem mysteriösen Liebhaber besucht wurde [#10]. Um herauszufinden, wer der Liebhaber war, schmierte die Frau ihre Hände mit dem Ruß vom Boden eines Topfes. Als sie am nächsten Tag aufwachte, stellte sie fest, dass das Gesicht ihres Bruders mit Ruß bedeckt war und erkannte, dass er sie nachts besuchte. Alle in ihrer Gemeinde begannen, dem inzestuösen Bruder auszuweichen, der sich so schämte, dass er sich von den Menschen fernhielt und schließlich zum Himmel aufstieg und zum Mond wurde. Deshalb ist laut Lokono das Gesicht des Mondes heute schmutzig. Der Mond erscheint auch in einem anderen Mythos. In dem Lokono-Mythos über einen Mann, der auf einer oben erwähnten unbewohnten Insel festsitzt, kommt ein anderes Boot an dem Mann vorbei, aber diesmal ist der Mond drinnen, der beschließt, dem Mann zu helfen, da die Menschen immer froh sind, wenn der Mond nachts herauskommt [#11]. Der Mond und die Sonne werden auch als Gegner dargestellt. In früheren Zeiten glaubte der Lokono, dass die Mondfinsternis sein Tod ist (kathi ôdon_ 'Mond stirbt') und würde die ganze Nacht Wache halten. [#6] Die Lokono sagen während der Mondfinsternis, dass der Mond eingeschlafen ist der Weg der Sonne [#11]. Deshalb machen sie viel Lärm, spielen Schlagzeug und blasen Muscheltrompeten, um ihn aufzuwecken. Bei Vollmond würden Mütter die Augen ihrer Kinder bedecken, damit sie nicht krank werden.\n"
"\n"
"Warhokoma 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"Der Planet Venus, sowohl wenn er morgens als Morgenstern als auch abends als Abendstern erscheint, wird vom Lokono Warhokoma genannt [#8] [#14] [#15]. Charles Dance hingegen berichtet über die Begriffe _Eweiwah_ und _Huewah_, wahrscheinlich die Entsprechungen des allgemeinen Begriffs _wiwa_\n"
"\"Stern\", der für jeden leuchtenden Himmelskörper verwendet werden kann [#16]. Die Lokono sprechen auch von Venus als \"Hiyaro wiwa\" \"Frauenstern\". In diesem Zusammenhang verdient es eine Erwähnung, dass Claudius de Goeje berichtet, dass, wenn Hiyaro wiwa in der Nähe des Mondes erscheint und ein Mädchen kurz vor seiner ersten Menstruation steht, die Lokono sagen, dass das Mädchen bald vom Mond berührt wird [#5]. Es gibt keinen Mythos über Warhokoma spezifisch und seine Beziehung zum Mond, aber es ist erwähnenswert, dass die Lokono eine Geschichte kennen, in der der Mond ursprünglich ein Mann war, der Inzest mit seiner Schwester begangen hat (siehe den unter Kathi erwähnten Mythos), und hat einen Namen als Womanizer [#10]. Interessanterweise erscheint der Name Warhokoma für Morgen- oder Abendstern auch in Kari'na, die ihn auch als die Frau des Mondes sehen [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milchstraße'\n"
"\n"
"Die Milchstraße ist unter den Lokono buchstäblich als _Waya nukuthi bunaha_ bekannt\n"
"„Weg der Tonträger“. Die Milchstraße repräsentiert die Fußabdrücke von Männern, die einst Ton für die Herstellung von Töpfen holten, eine Kunst, die der Lokono heute selten oder gar nicht praktiziert. Die Herkunft des Namens ist jedoch noch bekannt und in einem Mythos zusammengefasst [#19]. Der gleiche Name für die Milchstraße wurde von William Brett notiert, der hinzufügt, dass sie nach einer bestimmten weißlichen Tonart benannt ist [#14]. Charles Dance hingegen sagt, dass die Milchstraße die Fußabdrücke von Pekari darstellt, die den Ton verwurzeln, während Walter Roth eine andere Erklärung von Lokono erwähnt, wonach die Milchstraße einen Tapir darstellt, der von einem Hund und einem Jaguar verfolgt wird [#10]. [#16]. Diese beiden Quellen geben jedoch nicht den entsprechenden Lokono-Namen für die Milchstraße an, und es ist möglich, dass diese beiden Erklärungen ein Kari'na-Einfluss sind, der eine Konstellation eines Tigers erkennt, die der Konstellation eines Tapirs innerhalb der der Milch folgt Weg [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"Der moderne Lokono nennt Sirius _Mali_, dessen wörtliche Bedeutung unbekannt ist. Cornelius van Coll beschreibt einen Lokono-Stern namens _Mali_ und erklärt, dass es sich um einen sehr mächtigen Stern handelt [#7] [#17]. Wenn es im August morgens auftaucht, tötet es den Fisch in den Sümpfen und man sollte nicht darauf zeigen, sonst wird der Finger lahm. Cornelius van Colls _Mali_ markiert den Beginn der großen Trockenzeit (August bis Dezember), genannt in Lokono _malidalithe_, ein Begriff, der von _Mali_ abgeleitet ist. Ältere Quellen identifizierten Mali vorläufig als Lyra, Aquila oder Crux, aber da die große Trockenzeit um August beginnt und die Lokono die Sterne am Morgen beobachten, müssen diese Identifikationen falsch sein; Lyra, Aquila und Crux sind derzeit in den Lokono-Gebieten nicht zu sehen [#11] [#17]. Es gibt keine Lokono-Mythen über Mali, aber es gibt Beweise, die der Kari'na-Konstellation Ombatapo entsprechen könnten.\n"
"‘Vorheriges Gesicht’. Die Kari'na-Mythen erklären den Ursprung der Konstellation und ihren Namen, von dem angenommen wird, dass er wie der Lokono Mali den Fisch in den Sümpfen tötet und den Beginn der großen Trockenzeit ankündigt. Darüber hinaus wird die Kari'na Ombatapo als Teile von Puppis und Canis Major identifiziert, zu denen letzterer Sirius [#18] [#20] gehört."

"The constellation _Hithikoya_ is the ‘Spirit of the black curassow’ (_Crax\n"
"alector_), a commonly hunted bird, often kept as a pet for its feathers and\n"
"eggs. According to a Lokono myth, _Hithikoya_ lived on earth, but the Lokono\n"
"kept shooting him.[#11] As a result, he ascended to the sky to warn black\n"
"curassows about the approaching hunter (see _Yokhârhin_) and his companion with\n"

"curassows roam on the ground and are easy to catch. Over the following months,\n"
"the higher _Hithikoya_ rises in the morning, the higher the birds climb up the\n"
"trees. By March, it appears high in the sky and the birds are found in the tops\n"
"of the trees. _Hithikoya_ thus informs the Lokono where to search for the birds\n"

"Im März erscheint es hoch am Himmel und die Vögel sind oben auf den Bäumen "
