"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"
"which includes Sirius [#18][#20]."

"ال لوكونو ، المعروف أيضًا باسم أراواك ، هم من السكان الأصليين في غيانا ، تمتد أراضيهم على طول ساحل المحيط الأطلسي ، من شمال غرب غيانا ، عبر سورينام ، إلى شمال غرب غيانا الفرنسية (انظر الخريطة) [#1]. يتحدث Lokono لغة تنتمي إلى عائلة لغة Arawakan ، وهي واحدة من أكبر التجمعات اللغوية في القارة. مثل العديد من أقاربهم اللغويين ، فإن Lokono هم مزارعون متخصصون في زراعة المنيهوت (_Manihot esculenta_) ، والذين يمارسون أيضًا صيد الأسماك والصيد وجمع النباتات البرية. ومع ذلك ، باعتبارها واحدة من أولى مجموعات السكان الأصليين التي واجهها الأوروبيون في وقت الفتح ، كانت لوكونو على اتصال مع السكان غير الأصليين لأكثر من 500 سنة [#2]. تكثف هذا الاتصال في القرن الماضي ، مما أدى إلى فقدان كبير للغة Lokono ، والثقافة التقليدية والمواد غير المادية ، والتغيرات في ممارسات الكفاف ، وعلى وجه الخصوص إلى اختفاء _الطب _ رجال_ ، الناقلين التقليديين للمعرفة الروحية ، على الأرجح بما في ذلك المعرفة العرقية - الفندقيّة.\n"

"ونتيجة لذلك ، يبدو أن المعرفة الحديثة عن الأجرام السماوية ليست سوى جزء بسيط مما كان يعرفه Lokono عن النجوم في الماضي. يتم نسيان العديد من الأبراج المذكورة في المصادر القديمة أو أنها معروفة فقط من أسمائها ، بينما تم نسيان مجموعات النجوم التي تمثلها والتقاليد الشفوية التي توضح أصلها وأهميتها. تتضمن ثقافة السماء المعروضة هنا الأبراج المحددة فقط ولكن الوصف التالي يوفر سردًا أكثر شمولًا للمعرفة الفلكية في Lokono بما في ذلك المعلومات المستخرجة من مصادر تاريخية حول جميع الأجرام السماوية المذكورة في الجدول أدناه.\n"

"من الروايات المعاصرة والتاريخية ، يبدو أن المعرفة الفلكية لم تقتصر على أعضاء معينين في مجتمع Lokono. ومع ذلك ، كان رجال الطب على وجه الخصوص - القادة الروحيون في Lokono المعروف باسم _semethi_ - مطالبين بإتقان الجوانب المختلفة لمعرفة النجوم والذين ربما كانوا مسؤولين عن تمرير التقاليد الشفوية المرتبطة بهم من جيل إلى آخر آخر. من رودريغو دي نافاريت ، الذي كتب حوالي عام 1550 أحد الحسابات الأولى لـ Lokono ، نتعلم ، على سبيل المثال ، أن: \"كبار السن والحكماء الذين يسمونهم _Cemetu_ يتجمعون في المنازل المصممة لاجتماعاتهم و (...) يرون تقاليد واستغلال أسلافهم ورجالهم العظماء ، وكذلك سرد ما سمعه هؤلاء الأسلاف من أجدادهم ؛ بحيث يتذكرون بهذه الطريقة الأحداث القديمة لبلادهم وشعبهم. وبنفس الطريقة يرددون أو يعظون عن الأحداث المتعلقة بالسماء والشمس والقمر والنجوم \". [#3]\n"
"\n"
"تخلي Navarette's _cemetu_ ، رجال الطب المعروفين في Lokono الحديثة باسم _semethi_ ، إلى حد كبير عن ممارساتهم اليوم ، وهو ما قد يكون السبب في توقف نقل المعرفة الفلكية. يبدو أن العديد من الأبراج Lokono قد تم نسيانها اليوم. لذلك ، تقتصر مصادرنا غالبًا على الحسابات التاريخية المكتوبة من قبل المستكشفين الأوائل وعلماء الإثنوغرافيا في غيانا ، أحد أقدم الأمثلة الموضحة أدناه.\n"

"هذه الأدبيات هي التي تسمح لنا بإعادة بناء المعرفة النجمية في Lokono ، الموضحة أدناه. قبل مناقشة الأجرام السماوية الفردية ، ومع ذلك ، فإن العديد من السمات العامة لعلم الفلك Lokono تستحق الذكر ، وهي:\n"
"\n"
"* التداخل مع التقاليد الفلكية لجماعات السكان الأصليين المجاورة.\n"
"* التقاليد الشفوية تشرح أصل وأهمية الأجرام السماوية.\n"
"* استخدام مصطلح _koya_ \"روح\" في أسماء الأبراج العديدة.\n"
"* استخدام المصطلح العام _wiwa_ \"نجمة ، سنة\" وعدم وجود مصطلحات فلكية أخرى.\n"
"* ممارسات مشاهدة السماء من Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. تقاسم المعرفة الغويانية\n"
"\n"
"يحد إقليم لوكونو من شعبين أصليين غير مرتبطين لغويًا ، وهما كاريانا ، يتحدثان لغة كاريبان ، وواراو يتحدثون لغة معزولة. على الرغم من عدم ارتباطها تقليديًا وعدم تزاوجها ، إلا أن المجموعات الثلاث تشترك في قدر كبير من الثقافة المادية وغير المادية. يُظهر التقليد الإثنولوجي الفكري للشعوب الثلاثة أيضًا عددًا من أوجه التشابه اللافتة ، مثل الأساطير النجمية المشتركة ، وأسماء مماثلة من الأبراج ، والتوازي في التقويم النجمي. ويتحدث هذا عن الاتصالات بين المجموعات الثلاث وإلى تبادل المعرفة الفلكية ، التي يمكن أن ييسرها قادتهم الروحيون ، مثل Lokono _semethi_. تتطلب درجة تداخل هذه التقاليد واتجاهية تبادلهما مزيدًا من الدراسة. هنا ، نحن نركز على Lokono وبالتالي لا نناقش هذه الاقتراضات الثقافية بالتفصيل ، ما لم تسلط الضوء على فن الطهو Lokono العرقي.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. التقاليد الشفوية النجمية\n"
"\n"
"واحدة من هذه الميزات المشتركة هي الأساطير حول النجوم. تحكي هذه التقاليد الشفوية عن أصول الأجرام السماوية المعينة ، وتربطها ببعضها البعض ، وتشرح تأثيرها على العالم الطبيعي. كوكبة Lokono _Hithikoya_ \"روح المنحنى الأسود\" ، على سبيل المثال ، مرتبطة في أسطورة Lokono بأسطورة _Yokhârhin_ \"Hunter\" و _Alêti_ \"Torch\" ، وكلها ثلاث لها مكافئات Kari’na و Warao. هذه التقاليد الشفوية ، التي يحتفظ بها رجال الطب ، من المحتمل أن تكون بمثابة الأداة الرئيسية التي تنتقل من خلالها المعرفة الفلكية من جيل إلى آخر. لهذا السبب ، يتم إعطاء ملخصات للأساطير ذات الصلة في وصف مجموعات معينة. في بعض الأحيان ، عندما لا يتم توثيق أسطورة Lokono ذات الصلة ، تتم الإشارة إلى أساطير الجماعات المجاورة من أجل توضيح أهمية الأجرام السماوية. وبالنظر إلى أن العديد من هذه التقاليد الشفهية مشتركة من قبل Lokono والمجموعات المجاورة ، فإن هذا التعزيز للمعرفة الفلكية Lokono المحفوظة بشكل سيء له ما يبرره.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. تقويم الأرواح\n"
"\n"
"يعد مصطلح \"روح\" kk ، الموجود في العديد من أسماء الأبراج التي تتبع عادةً مصطلحًا لنبات أو حيوان معين ، سمة رئيسية لعلم الفلك Lokono. يشرح والتر روث ، عالم الإثنوغرافيا في غيانا ، أن مثل هذه الأبراج هي أرواح الكائنات المقابلة. [#4] في وقت من السنة التي تظهر فيها الكوكبة ، تنتقل الروح من السماء إلى الأرض لتنفس الحياة في الكائنات. يمثل. على هذا النحو ، شكلت مجموعات _koya_ تقويمًا ، يشير إلى أفضل وقت للمشاركة في أنشطة الكفاف المتعلقة بهذه النباتات والحيوانات (مثل الصيد أو التجمع). قد يكون Lokono قد عرف أيضًا مكان هبوط هذه الأرواح على الأرض. يقترح والتر روث أن يطلقوا على هذه الأماكن نفس أسماء الأبراج ولكن الدليل على ذلك لا يزال ضعيفًا. وهكذا ، _Hadorhikoya_ \"روح الأكوشي الأحمر\" تشير إلى الروح ، والكوكبة ، والمكان الذي يوجد فيه _hadorhi_ في الكثير عندما تظهر كوكبة. بينما يتم نسيان هذه المعرفة عن أسماء المواقع الجغرافية اليوم ، تذكرنا كوكبات _koya_ بالفهم الكبير لحياة النبات والحيوان التي يمتلكها Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. النجم والسنة ويوا\n"
"\n"
"لدى Lokono أيضًا مصطلح عام آخر يُستخدم للإشارة إلى النجوم ، _wiwa_. يفتقر المصطلح إلى الدلالات الروحية لـ _koya._ وهو يشير ، من ناحية ، إلى الجودة المادية للنجوم كشيء لامع ، ومن ناحية أخرى ، إلى السنة التقويمية. على هذا النحو ، يتم استخدامه ، على سبيل المثال ، عند الحديث عن عمر الشخص. بينما يمكن تطبيقه على أي نجم ، يظهر _wiwa فقط في اسمين مناسبين للأجرام السماوية. يُعد _Yôkoro wiwa_ ، حرفياً \"عشرات النجوم\" (الثريا) ، أهم مجموعات كوكبة Lokono ، التي يبدأ مظهرها تقليديًا في السنة التقويمية Lokono. فيما يلي _Yôkoro wiwa_ هي العديد من مجموعات _koya_ ، كل منها يشير إلى موسم مختلف في تقويم Lokono. من ناحية أخرى ، يبدو أن ويوا كالميرو ، حرفيا \"النجم الساطع\" (المشتري) قد تم تحديده فقط بسبب سطوعه. بصرف النظر عن _wiwa_ و _koya_ ، لا توجد مصطلحات عامة تميز الكواكب والنجوم والأقمار والشمس والمجرات وما إلى ذلك بلغة Lokono. لهذا السبب ، يتم تضمين مكافئ Lokono لدرب التبانة ، على سبيل المثال ، من بين الأبراج الأخرى.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. ممارسات مشاهدة السماء\n"
"\n"
"في حين يمكن لـ Lokono الاستمتاع بالسماء في المساء ، لمتابعة تقويم Lokono النجمي ، يجب على المرء أن ينظر إلى الأبراج حوالي الساعة 4 صباحًا ، وهو الوقت الذي يستيقظ فيه Lokono عادةً. وبالتالي فإن Lokono يلاحظ صعود الأبراج في الصباح. للحصول على الفكرة الصحيحة لدورة الأبراج السنوية ، يجب على المرء أيضًا تعيين موقع العرض على Guianas (مثل Georgetown أو Paramaribo أو Cayenne في قائمة الموقع). تجدر الإشارة إلى أن العديد من Lokono ، عند رسم الأبراج ، لم يربط النجوم بخطوط ، وفي بعض الحالات ، كان هناك القليل من التوافق بين المتحدثين حول أي نجم داخل كوكبة يتوافق مع أي أجزاء من النبات أو الحيوان الذي يمثله. في Stellarium ، نحن نمثل الأبراج ذات الخطوط ، ولكن يجب أن يوضع في الاعتبار أن هذا قد يكون تشويهًا لتقليد Lokono ، والذي يسمح بمزيد من المرونة في تفسير مجموعات نجوم معينة. أخيرًا ، هناك قيود على النظر إلى بعض الأجرام السماوية ، حيث يُعتقد أن اللعق يمكن أن يؤذي الشخص إذا نظر إلى [#5]. على سبيل المثال ، عند اكتمال القمر ، غطت الأمهات عيون أطفالهن حتى لا يمرضن [#6]. تم إخبار الشباب أيضًا بعدم النظر إلى _Yôkoro wiwa_ (الثريا) ، وإلا فلن ينمو [#7]. تنطبق هذه الممارسات أيضًا على أشياء أخرى يُعتقد أنها تحتوي على معنويات قوية وتضمنت طرقًا أخرى لتجنب ملامسة العين للأرواح مثل فرك أو ليمون أو ملح في عين المرء.\n"
"\n"
"### الأجرام السماوية Lokono\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"مصطلح لوكونو للشمس هو __حادلي_ ، كما يُطلق عليه _ادالي_. يقترح Claaudius de Goeje أن الأسماء المختلفة لبطل ثقافة Lokono ، أول رجل دوائي معروف باسم _Harlitvanli_ ، _Haliwalika_ ، _Halwanli_ ، _Hariwalli_ ، و _Arawanili_ ، وأحيانًا _Arawidi_ ، قد تشير جميعها إلى نفس البطل المحدد باسم الشمس [#8]. بينما لا يمكننا تأكيد هذه الفرضية ، فإن أسطورة _Arawidi_ جديرة بالذكر. في أسطورة Lokono ، _Arawidi_ ، الشمس ، هو والد رجل يصبح كوكبة _Mabukuli_ \"رجل بلا فخذ\" (حزام Orion) [#9] [#10] [#11]. بحسب القصة ، كانت الشمس تأتي إلى الأرض على شكل رجل يدعى _Arawidi_ لمقابلة عشيقته التي كان لديها توائم. في حلقة لاحقة من الأسطورة ، يتزوج أحد التوائم من امرأة يقرر والدها قتلها. عندما يحاولون الهرب ، تلاحقهم أخت الزوجة وتمكن من قطع ساقه انتقاما. ونتيجة لذلك ، صعد الرجل إلى السماء وأصبح كوكبة _Mabukuli. تحذر أسطورة أخرى من Lokono من الإساءة للشمس: رجل عالق في جزيرة غير مأهولة وسط مستنقع ، يصرخ طلبًا للمساعدة. يمر به قارب ، ولكن داخل القارب توجد الشمس ، التي لا تريد مساعدة الرجل ، حيث يشكو الناس دائمًا من أن الشمس تشرق بشدة [#11]. فيما يتعلق بالممارسات المتعلقة بالشمس ، أفاد Im Thurn أنه من بين Lokono ، كان كسوف الشمس يعتبر حربًا بين _Hadali_ و _Kathi_ ، القمر ، وأن Lokono سوف يصرخ ويصدر جميع أنواع الضوضاء لإيقافها من قتال [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_كاثي_ القمر\n"
"\n"
"يُعرف القمر باسم _Kathi_ ، وهو مصطلح سجل لأول مرة من قبل Joannes de Laet باسم _cattehee_ حوالي عام 1598 ، ويستخدم أيضًا للإشارة إلى الشهر القمري [#13]. وفقا ل Lokono ، القمر ، مثل الشمس ، كان رجلا ذات مرة. أفاد والتر روث عن أسطورة Lokono ، حيث تمت زيارة امرأة شابة من قبل عاشق غامض ليلًا بعد ليلة [#10]. لمعرفة من هو الحبيب ، لطخت المرأة يديها بالسخام من قاع الإناء. في اليوم التالي ، عندما استيقظت ، وجدت أن وجه شقيقها كان مغطى بالسخام وأدركت أنه هو الذي زارها في الليل. بدأ كل فرد في مجتمعها يتجنب الأخ المحارم ، الذي أصبح يشعر بالخجل لدرجة أنه ابتعد عن الناس وصعد في النهاية إلى السماء ، وأصبح القمر. هذا هو السبب في أن وجه القمر قذر اليوم ، وفقًا لـ Lokono. يظهر القمر أيضًا في أسطورة أخرى. في أسطورة Lokono حول رجل عالق في جزيرة غير مأهولة المذكورة أعلاه ، يمر قارب آخر بالرجل ، ولكن هذه المرة في الداخل القمر ، الذي يقرر مساعدة الرجل ، لأن الناس سعداء دائمًا برؤية القمر يخرج ليلًا [#11]. كما تم تصوير القمر والشمس كمعارضين. في الأوقات السابقة ، اعتقد لوكونو أن كسوف القمر هو موته (كاتي أودون \"يموت القمر\") وسيظل يشاهد طوال الليل. [#6] يقول لوكونو خلال كسوف القمر أن القمر قد نام على القمر مسار الشمس [#11]. لذلك ، يصدرون الكثير من الضوضاء ، ويلعبون الطبول ويفجرون أبواق الصدفة لإيقاظه. بالقمر الكامل ، تغطي الأمهات عيون أطفالهن حتى لا يمرضن.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ \"فينوس\"\n"
"\n"
"كوكب الزهرة ، سواء عندما يظهر في الصباح كنجمة الصباح وعندما يظهر في المساء كنجم المساء ، يسمى _Warhokoma_ بواسطة Lokono [#8] [#14] [#15]. تشارلز دانس ، من ناحية أخرى ، يورد المصطلحين _Eweiwah_ و _Huewah_ ، على الأرجح معادل المصطلح العام _wiwa_\n"
"\"نجمة\" والتي يمكن استخدامها لأي جسم سماوي لامع [#16]. يتحدث Lokono أيضًا عن كوكب الزهرة كـ _Hiyaro wiwa_ \"نجمة المرأة\". فيما يتعلق بهذا ، تجدر الإشارة إلى أن كلوديوس دي جوي أفاد أنه عندما يظهر هيارو ويوا بالقرب من القمر ، وأن الفتاة على وشك أن تكون أول حيض لها ، تقول لوكونو أن الفتاة ستلمس القمر قريبًا [#5]. لا توجد أسطورة حول _Warhokoma_ على وجه التحديد وعلاقتها بالقمر ، ولكن من الجدير بالذكر أن Lokono يعرف قصة ، حيث كان القمر في الأصل رجلًا ارتكب سفاح القربى مع أخته (انظر الأسطورة المذكورة تحت _Kathi_) ، و له اسم باعتباره زير نساء [#10]. ومن المثير للاهتمام أن اسم _Warhokoma_ لـ Morning أو Evening Star يظهر أيضًا في Kari’na ، الذين يرونه أيضًا كزوجة القمر [#17] [#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ \"درب التبانة\"\n"
"\n"
"تُعرف درب التبانة بين Lokono باسم _Waya nukuthi bunaha_ ، حرفياً\n"
"\"مسار حاملات الطين\". تمثل درب التبانة آثار أقدام الرجال الذين ذهبوا ذات مرة لجلب الطين لصنع الأواني ، وهو فن نادرًا ما يمارسه Lokono اليوم. ومع ذلك ، لا يزال أصل الاسم معروفًا ، وقد تم تلخيصه في أسطورة [#19]. لاحظ ويليام بريت نفس الاسم لدرب التبانة الذي أضاف أنه تمت تسميته بعد نوع أبيض محدد من الطين [#14]. من ناحية أخرى ، يقول تشارلز دانس أن درب التبانة يمثل آثار أقدام البيكاري في تجذير الصلصال ، في حين يذكر والتر روث شرحًا مختلفًا للوكونو ، حيث تمثل درب التبانة تابير يلاحقه كلب وجاغوار [#10] [#16]. ومع ذلك ، لا يعطي هذان المصدران اسم Lokono المقابل لدرب التبانة ، ومن المحتمل أن هذين التفسرين هما تأثير Kari'na ، الذين يتعرفون على كوكبة النمر بعد كوكبة التابير داخل كوكبة درب التبانة. الطريقة [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_مالي_ سيريوس\n"
"\n"
"يطلق Lokono الحديث على Sirius _Mali_ ، والمعنى الحرفي غير معروف. يصف كورنيليوس فان كول نجم Lokono يسمى _Mali_ ويوضح أنه نجم قوي جدًا [#7] [#17]. عندما يأتي في الصباح في أغسطس ، فإنه يقتل الأسماك في المستنقعات ، ولا يجب على المرء أن يشير إليها أو سيصبح أحد أصابعه عرجًا. يمثل _Mali_ كورنيليوس فان كول بداية موسم الجفاف الكبير (أغسطس إلى ديسمبر) ، ودعا في Lokono _malidalithe_ ، وهو مصطلح مشتق من _Mali_. حددت مصادر أقدم _Mali_ مؤقتًا باسم Lyra أو Aquila أو Crux ، ولكن نظرًا لأن موسم الجفاف الكبير يبدأ في أغسطس تقريبًا وأن Lokono يراقب النجوم في الصباح ، يجب أن تكون هذه التعريفات غير صحيحة ؛ لا يمكن رؤية Lyra و Aquila و Crux في الوقت الحالي من مناطق Lokono [#11] [#17]. لا توجد أساطير Lokono حول _Mali_ ، ولكن هناك أدلة قد تتوافق مع كوكبة Kari’na _Ombatapo_\n"
"\"الوجه السابق\". تفسر أساطير Kari’na أصل الكوكبة واسمها ، والتي ، مثل Lokono _Mali_ ، يعتقد أنها تقتل الأسماك في المستنقعات وتعلن عن بداية موسم الجفاف الكبير. علاوة على ذلك ، تم تحديد Kari’na _Ombatapo_ كأجزاء من Puppis و Canis Major ، والتي تشتمل الأخيرة على Sirius [#18] [#20]."

"curassows about the approaching hunter (see _Yokhârhin_) and his companion with\n"

"of the trees. _Hithikoya_ thus informs the Lokono where to search for the birds\n"
