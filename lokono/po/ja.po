"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical\n"
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society.\n"
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular — the spiritual leaders of the\n"
"Lokono known as _semethi_ — who were required to master the various aspects of\n"
"star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral\n"
"traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de\n"
"Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we\n"
"learn, for instance, that: “old and wise men whom they call _Cemetu_ assemble\n"
"in the houses designed for their meetings and (...) recount the traditions and\n"
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those\n"
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember\n"
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they\n"
"recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and\n"
"stars.”[#3]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's _cemetu_, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as _semethi_,\n"
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the\n"
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono\n"
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore\n"
"often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and\n"
"ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is\n"
"illustrated below.\n"
"\n"
"![](schulz.webp)\n"
"Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803 [#23].\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar\n"
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies,\n"
"however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
"*   the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
"*   the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
"*   the use of the term _koya_ ‘spirit’ in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
"*   the use of the general term _wiwa_ ‘star, year’ and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
"*   the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous\n"
"peoples, the Kari’na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a\n"
"language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the\n"
"three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture.\n"
"Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of\n"
"striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of\n"
"constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the\n"
"contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical\n"
"knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as\n"
"the Lokono _semethi_. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the\n"
"directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the\n"
"Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless\n"
"they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of\n"
"the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and\n"
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation\n"
"_Hithikoya_ ‘Spirit of the black curassow’, for instance, is linked in a Lokono\n"
"myth to that of _Yokhârhin_ ‘Hunter’ and _Alêti_ ‘Torch’, all three of which\n"
"have Kari’na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by\n"
"the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which\n"
"astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this\n"
"reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of\n"
"particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not\n"
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to\n"
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of\n"
"such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this\n"
"enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term _koya_ ‘spirit’, found in numerous constellation names typically\n"
"following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono\n"
"astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such\n"
"constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of\n"
"the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to\n"
"earth to breath life into the beings it represents. As such, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to\n"
"engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g.\n"
"hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would\n"
"descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the\n"
"same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus,\n"
"_Hadorhikoya_ ‘Spirit of the red acouchi’ would refer to the spirit, the\n"
"constellation, and the place where the _hadorhi_ is found in plenty when its\n"
"constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the\n"
"_koya_-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and\n"
"animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars,\n"
"_wiwa_. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of _koya._ It refers, on the\n"
"one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the\n"
"other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when\n"
"talking about one’s age. While it can apply to any star, _wiwa_ appears only in\n"
"two proper names of celestial bodies. _Yôkoro wiwa_, literally ‘Scores of\n"
"stars’ (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose\n"
"appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ are the numerous _koya_-constellations, each signaling a different season\n"
"in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, _Wiwa kalemero_, literally ‘Shining\n"
"star’ (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness.\n"
"Apart from _wiwa_ and _koya_, there are no generic terms distinguishing\n"
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For\n"
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included\n"
"among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono\n"
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the\n"
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the\n"
"rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the\n"
"yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the\n"
"Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It\n"
"merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect\n"
"the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among\n"
"speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of\n"
"the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations\n"
"with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the\n"
"Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular\n"
"star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial\n"
"bodies, since it is believed that a spirt can harm one if looked at [#5]. For\n"
"instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they\n"
"would not become sick [#6]. Young people were also told not to look at _Yôkoro\n"
"wiwa_ (Pleiades), or else they would not grow [#7]. Such practices applied also\n"
"to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of\n"
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into\n"
"one’s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"_Hadali_ 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is _Hadali_, also pronounced as _Adali_. Claaudius\n"
"de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero,\n"
"the first medicine-man known as _Harlitvanli_, _Haliwalika_, _Halwanli_,\n"
"_Hariwalli_, and _Arawanili_, and sometimes _Arawidi_, may all refer to the\n"
"same hero identified as the Sun [#8]. While we cannot confirm this hypothesis,\n"
"the myth of _Arawidi_ is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, _Arawidi_, the\n"
"Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation _Mabukuli_ ‘Man\n"
"without a thigh’ (Orion’s belt) [#9][#10][#11]. According to the story, the\n"
"Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called _Arawidi_ to meet his\n"
"lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins\n"
"marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to\n"
"escape, the wife’s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in\n"
"revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation\n"
"_Mabukuli_. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck\n"
"on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat\n"
"passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the\n"
"man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard [#11]. As far as\n"
"practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the\n"
"eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between _Hadali_ and _Kathi_, the Moon,\n"
"and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from\n"
"fighting [#12].\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as _Kathi_, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as\n"
"_cattehee_ around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month [#13].\n"
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth\n"
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover\n"
"night after night [#10]. To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her\n"
"hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she\n"
"found that her brother’s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who\n"
"visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the\n"
"incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and\n"
"ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to\n"
"the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in\n"
"another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island\n"
"mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon,\n"
"which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon\n"
"come out at night [#11]. The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In\n"
"previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death\n"
"(_kathi ôdon_ ‘moon dying’) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say\n"
"during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun’s\n"
"path [#11]. Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell\n"
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their\n"
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and\n"
"when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called _Warhokoma_ by\n"
"the Lokono [#8][#14][#15]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms\n"
"_Eweiwah_ and _Huewah_, probably the equivalents of the general term _wiwa_\n"
"‘star’ which can be used for any shining celestial body [#16]. The Lokono also\n"
"speak of Venus as _Hiyaro wiwa_ ‘women’s star’. In relation to this, it merits\n"
"a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when _Hiyaro wiwa_ appears close\n"
"to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say\n"
"that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon [#5]. There is no myth about\n"
"_Warhokoma_ specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth\n"
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man\n"
"who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under _Kathi_),\n"
"and has a name as a womanizer [#10]. Interestingly, the name _Warhokoma_ for\n"
"Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari’na, who see it also as the Moon's\n"
"wife [#17][#18].\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_ 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as _Waya nukuthi bunaha_, literally\n"
"‘Path of the carriers of clay’. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men\n"
"who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all,\n"
"practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known,\n"
"and is summarized in a myth [#19]. The same name for Milky Way was noted by\n"
"William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of\n"
"clay [#14]. Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents\n"
"the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a\n"
"different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a\n"
"tapir chased by a dog and jaguar [#10][#16]. However, these two sources do not\n"
"give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that\n"
"these two explanations are a Kari’na influence, who recognize a constellation\n"
"of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky\n"
"Way [#17].\n"
"\n"
"_Mali_ 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius _Mali_, the literal meaning of which is unknown.\n"
"Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called _Mali_ and explains that it\n"
"is a very powerful star [#7][#17]. When it comes up in the morning in August,\n"
"it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one’s finger\n"
"will become lame. Cornelius van Coll’s _Mali_ marks the beginning of the big\n"
"dry season (August to December), called in Lokono _malidalithe_, a term derived\n"
"from _Mali_. Older sources identified _Mali_ tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or\n"
"Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the\n"
"Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be\n"
"incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono\n"
"territories [#11][#17]. There are no Lokono myths about _Mali_, but there is\n"
"evidence that is may correspond to the Kari’na constellation _Ombatapo_\n"
"‘Previous face’. The Kari’na myths explain the origin of the constellation and\n"
"its name, which, like the Lokono _Mali_, is believed to kill the fish in the\n"
"swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari’na\n"
"_Ombatapo_ is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of\n"

"### ロコノの天文学的知識：はじめに\n"
"\n"
"現代的および歴史的な説明から、天文学の知識はロコノ社会の特定のメンバーに制限されていなかったように見えます。ただし、特に星の知識のさまざまな側面を習得する必要があり、それに関連する口承の伝統を1世代から別の。 1550年頃にロコノの最初の記述の1つを書いたロドリゴデナヴァレットから、たとえば、次のことを学びます。「彼らが_Cemetu_と呼ぶ老人と賢者は、会議用に設計された家に集まり、（...）彼らの祖先と偉人の伝統と功績、そしてそれらの祖先が彼らの祖先から聞いたことをナレーションします。このようにして、彼らは自分の国と人々の最も古い出来事を覚えています。そして、同じように、彼らは天、太陽、月、星に関連する出来事について語ったり説教したりしている。」[#3]\n"
"\n"
"ナバレットの_cemetu_は、現代のロコノで_semethi_として知られている医学者であり、今日では主に彼らの慣行をあきらめており、それが天文学の知識の伝達が中断された理由かもしれません。多くのロコノ星座は今日忘れられたようです。したがって、私たちの出典は、ギアナの初期の探検家や民族誌学者によって書かれた歴史的記述に限定されることがよくあります。その最古の例の1つを以下に示します。\n"

"以下で説明するロコノの恒星の知識をパーティーで再構成できるのはこの文献です。ただし、個々の天体について説明する前に、ロコノ天文学のいくつかの一般的な特徴について言及する価値があります。\n"
"\n"
"*近隣の先住民族の天文学の伝統との重複。\n"
"*天体の起源と重要性を説明する口承の伝統。\n"
"*多数の星座の名前における_koya_「精神」という用語の使用。\n"
"*一般的な用語「_wiwa_」「スター、年」の使用、および他の天文用語の欠如。\n"
"*ロコノのスカイウォッチングの練習。\n"
"\n"
"### 1.共有されたガイアナの知識\n"
"\n"
"ロコノ語の領土は、言語的に関連のない2つの先住民族、カリバン語を話すカリナ語と言語分離語を話すワラオ語の境界にあります。 3つのグループは無関係であり、伝統的に相互関係はありませんが、多くの物質的および非物質的文化を共有しています。三民族の民族占星術の伝統はまた、共有された恒星神話、星座の同様の名前、恒星暦の類似点など、多くの印象的な類似点を示しています。これは、3つのグループ間の接触と、おそらくロコノ_semethi_などのそれぞれの精神的指導者によって促進された天文学の知識の交換について語っています。これらの伝統がどの程度重なっているのか、そしてそれらの交換の方向性には、さらなる研究が必要です。ここでは、ロコノに焦点を当てているため、ロコノ民族天文学に光を当てない限り、これらの文化的借用については詳しく説明しません。\n"
"\n"
"### 2.優れた口頭伝承\n"
"\n"
"そのような共有機能の1つは、星に関する神話です。そのような口承の伝統は、特定の天体の起源を伝え、それらを互いに結びつけ、自然界への影響を説明しています。たとえば、ロコノ星座_Hithikoya_ 'スピリットオブブラッククラソウ'は、ロコノ神話で_Yokhârhin_ 'ハンター'と_Alêti_ 'トーチ'の神話にリンクされています。これらの3つすべてに、カーリーナとワラオに相当します。天文学の知識が世代を超えて伝えられてきた主な手段として役立ったのは、医学者によって保存されたこれらの口承の伝統です。このため、関連する神話の概要は、特定の星座の説明に記載されています。時折、関連するロコノ神話が文書化されていない場合、特定の天体の重要性を明らかにするために、隣接するグループの神話が参照されます。そのような口承の伝統の多くがロコノと近隣のグループによって共有されていることを考えると、保存状態の悪いロコノの天文学的知識のこの強化は正当化されます。\n"
"\n"
"### 3.スピリッツのカレンダー\n"
"\n"
"ロコノ天文学の主要な特徴は、特定の植物または動物の用語に通常続く多数の星座名に含まれる「_koya_」「精神」という用語です。ギアナの民族誌学者であるウォルター・ロスは、そのような星座は対応する存在の霊であると説明しています。[#4]星座が出現する時期、精神は空から地球へと移動し、生命を生き物に吹き込みますを表します。このように、_koya_-constellationsはカレンダーを形成し、これらの植物や動物に関連する生活活動（狩猟や採集など）に従事するのに最適な時期を示しています。ロコノはまた、そのような精霊が地球のどこに降りるかを知っているかもしれません。ウォルター・ロスは、星座と同じ名前でこれらの場所を呼んだことを示唆していますが、その証拠は依然として不十分です。したがって、_Hadorhikoya_の「赤いアコウチのスピリット」は、その精神、星座、およびその星座が出現したときに_hadorhi_が多く見つかる場所を指します。このトポロジー的な知識は今日忘れられていますが、_koya_-constellationsは、Lokonoが所有していた植物や動物の生命についての深い理解を思い出させてくれます。\n"
"\n"
"### 4. _Wiwa_、星と年\n"
"\n"
"ロコノ語には、星を表すために使用されるもう1つの一般的な用語_wiwa_もあります。この用語には、_koyaの精神的な意味合いが欠けています。一方は、星の物理的な質を輝くものとして、そして他方は暦年を指します。そのため、たとえば、年齢について話すときに使用されます。どの星にも適用できますが、_wiwa_は天体の2つの固有名にのみ表示されます。 _Yokoro wiwa_、文字通り「星のスコア」（プレアデス）は、伝統的にロコノ暦年から始まるすべてのロコノ星座の中で最も重要です。 _yokoro wiwa_に続いて、多数の_koya_-星座があり、それぞれがLokonoカレンダーの異なる季節を示しています。一方、_Wiwa kalemero_、文字通り「シャイニングスター」（ジュピター）は、その明るさのためだけに選択されたようです。 _wiwa_と_koya_以外に、ロコノ語では惑星、星、月、太陽、銀河などを区別する一般的な用語はありません。このため、たとえば天の川に相当するロコノは他の星座に含まれています。\n"
"\n"
"### 5.スカイウォッチングの練習\n"
"\n"
"ロコノは夕方に空を眺めることができますが、ロコノの恒星のカレンダーをたどるには、通常、ロコノが目を覚ましている午前4時頃に星座を見なければなりません。このようにロコノは朝の星座の上昇を観察します。星座の年間サイクルの正しいアイデアを取得するには、表示場所をギアナに設定する必要があります（たとえば、ロケーションメニューのジョージタウン、パラマリボ、カイエンなど）。多くのロコノが星座を描くときに星を線でつないでいないこと、そして星座内のどの星がそれが表す植物または動物のどの部分に対応するかについて話者間でほとんど合意がなかったことに言及する価値があります。 Stellariumでは、星座を線で表しますが、これはロコノの伝統の歪みである可能性があることに注意してください。これにより、特定の星のグループをより柔軟に解釈できるようになります。最後に、[#5]を見ると霊が害を及ぼす可能性があると考えられているため、一部の天体を見ることには制限があります。たとえば、満月までに、母親は病気にならないように子供たちの目を覆った[#6]。若い人々はまた_ヨコロワイワ_（プレアデス）を見ないように言われました、さもなければ彼らは成長しないでしょう[#7]。このような慣行は、強力なスピリットを宿していると信じられている他のオブジェクトにも適用され、ピーマン、ライム、または塩などのスピリッツとの目への接触を避ける他の方法が含まれていました。\n"
"\n"
"### ロコノ天体\n"
"\n"
"_ハダリ_「太陽」\n"
"\n"
"太陽のロコノ語は_Hadali_であり、_Adali_とも発音されます。クラウディウス・デ・ゲーエは、ロコノ文化の英雄、_Harlitvanli _、_ Haliwalika _、_ Halwanli _、_ Hariwalli_、および_Arawanili_、そして時には_Arawidi_として知られる最初の医学者のさまざまな綴りの名前はすべて、同じ英雄として識別された]。この仮説を確認することはできませんが、_Arawidi_の神話は言及する価値があります。ロコノ神話では、太陽の_Arawidi_は星座_Mabukuli_ ‘太もものない男’（Orionのベルト）[#9] [#10] [#11]になる父親です。話によると、太陽は、双子を飼っていた恋人に会うために、_アラウィディと呼ばれる男の形で地球にやって来ました。神話の後のエピソードでは、双子の1人が女性と結婚し、その母親が夫婦で殺すことにしました。彼らが逃げようとするとき、妻の妹は彼らを追いかけ、復讐でなんとか彼の足を切り落としました。その結果、男は空に昇り星座_まぶくり_になります。もう1つのロコノ神話は、太陽を害することに対して警告を発しています。沼地の真ん中にある無人島で立ち往生した男が助けを求めて叫びます。ボートは彼を通過しますが、ボートの内部には太陽があり、太陽はあまりにも強く輝いていると人々は常に不満を言うので、男性を助けたくありません[#11]。太陽に関連する慣習に関する限り、Im Thurnは、ロコノの間で、日食は_Hadali_と_Kathi_、月の間の戦争と見なされ、ロコノは叫び、あらゆる種類の騒音を発してそれらを阻止するだろうと報告しました戦闘[#12]。\n"
"\n"
"_Kathi_ '月'\n"
"\n"
"月は_Kathi_として知られており、Joannes de Laetによって1598年頃に_cattehee_として最初に記録された用語であり、旧暦の月[#13]の参照にも使用されます。ロコノによれば、月は太陽のようにかつては人間でした。ウォルターロスは、ロコノ神話を報告しています。そこでは、若い女性が不思議な恋人によって毎晩訪問されました[#10]。恋人が誰であるかを知るために、女性は鍋の底からすすを手に塗りました。翌日、彼女が目を覚ましたとき、彼女の兄の顔がすすで覆われているのを発見し、夜に彼女を訪ねたのは彼であることに気付きました。彼女のコミュニティの誰もが近親相姦の兄弟を避け始めました。兄弟は恥ずかしくなり、人々から遠ざかり、最終的には空に昇って月になりました。ロコノによれば、これが今日の月面が汚れている理由です。月は別の神話にも登場します。上記の無人島で男が立ち往生しているというロコノ神話では、別の船がその男を通り過ぎていますが、今度は月が登場します。月は夜に出てくるのを人々がいつも喜んでいるからです。 RefX11]。月と太陽も敵として描かれています。以前、ロコノは月食がその死（_kathiôdon_ 'moon dying'）であると信じ、一晩中見守っていたと考えられていました。[#6]ロコノは月が眠っている間に月が眠りについたと言います太陽のパス[#11]。したがって、彼らは多くの音を立て、ドラムを演奏し、シェルのトランペットを吹いて彼を起こしました。満月までに、母親は子供たちの目を覆い、病気にならないようにします。\n"
"\n"
"_Warhokoma_ 'ヴィーナス'\n"
"\n"
"惑星金星は、朝にモーニングスターとして現れるときと、夜にイブニングスターとして現れるときの両方で、ロコノ語によって_Warhokoma_と呼ばれています[#8] [#14] [#15]。一方、Charles Danceは_Eweiwah_および_Huewah_という用語を報告します。おそらく一般的な用語_wiwa_に相当します。\n"
"輝く天体[#16]に使用できる「星」。ロコノ語でもヴィーナスを_Hiyaro wiwa_の「女性のスター」と呼んでいます。これに関連して、それはクラウディウスデゴエジェが_Hiyaro wiwa_が月の近くに現れ、女の子が最初の月経を迎えようとしているときに、女の子がすぐに月に触れられると言う[#5]。特に_Warhokoma_とその月との関係についての神話はありませんが、Lokonoが物語を知っていることは覚えておく価値があります。月は元々、妹と近親相姦した男でした（_Kathi_で説明されている神話を参照）。女性化師としての名前があります[#10]。興味深いことに、モーリーまたはイブニングスターの名前である_Warhokoma_は、月の妻[#17] [#18]としても見られるカリナにも登場します。\n"
"\n"
"_Waya nukuthi bunaha_「天の川」\n"
"\n"
"天の川はロコノ人の間で_Waya nukuthi bunaha_として知られています。\n"
"「粘土運搬人の道」。天の川は、かつてポットを作るためにかつて粘土を取りに行った男性の足跡を表しています。芸術は、たとえあったとしても、今日のロコノによって実践されていることはほとんどありません。しかし、その名前の由来はまだ知られており、神話[#19]に要約されています。ミルキーウェイの同じ名前は、特定の白っぽいタイプの粘土[#14]にちなんで名付けられたとウィリアム・ブレットによって指摘されました。一方、チャールズダンスは、天の川が粘土を根付かせているペッカリーの足跡を表すと言い、ウォルターロスは別のロコノの説明に言及しています。それによれば、天の川は犬とジャガーに追われたバクを表します[#10] [#16]。ただし、これらの2つの情報源は天の川に対応するロコノの名前を示していません。これらの2つの説明は、天の川のバクの星座に続くトラの星座を認識するカリナの影響である可能性があります。方法[#17]。\n"
"\n"
"_マリ_ 'シリウス'\n"
"\n"
"現代のロコノ語はシリウスを_マリ_と呼びますが、その文字通りの意味は不明です。 Cornelius van Collは_Mali_と呼ばれるロコノの星について説明し、それは非常に強力な星であると説明しています[#7] [#17]。 8月の朝になると、沼地の魚を殺してしまいますので、指差ししないと指がガタガタになります。 Cornelius van Collの_Mali_は、Lokono _malidalithe_で呼ばれる大乾季（8月から12月）の始まりを示し、_Mali_から派生した用語です。古い情報筋は、一時的にLyra、Aquila、またはCruxと_Mali_を識別しましたが、8月頃に乾季が始まり、ロコノが朝に星を観測することを考えると、これらの識別は正しくないはずです。現在、Lyra、Aquila、およびCruxは、Lokono領域[#11] [#17]からは見ることができません。 _マリ_についてのロコノ神話はありませんが、カリナ星座_オンバタポ_に対応している可能性があるという証拠があります\n"
"「前の顔」。カリナ神話は星座の起源とその名前を説明しており、ロコノ_マリ_のように、沼地で魚を殺すと信じられており、乾季の始まりを告げています。さらに、カリナ_オンバタポ_は、PuppisおよびCanis Majorの一部として識別され、後者にはSirius [#18] [#20]が含まれます。"
