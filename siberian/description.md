# Siberian

## Introduction

Siberia is the Asian part of Russia, i.e. the northern third of the Asian
continent. As it belongs to Russia, the modern constellations are used there
since many centuries.

## Description

The names of the constellations of the native Siberian peoples and tribes is
poorly studied. Additonally, due to the large territory, the knowledge about
constellations is difficult to reconcile in a single integrated picture. In
this sky culture, only specific names and objects are marked which are typical
for whole of Siberia. There had been more in only certain areas of Siberia,
used by only a smaller group of people.

### Milky Way

The names of the Milky Way are quite numerous, but they can be distinguished
into two groups: (i) the names coming from the past (e.g., _Goose Road_) and
(ii) the name of a later periods (_Mamay Road_). The names of the later period
is are clearly influenced by the Mongol-Tatar invasion to Russia.

### Pleiades

The Pleiades have many names, even more than names for the Milky Way exist.
However, all of them in Siberia can be reduced to the notion for a star cluster
as a bird's nest. Among these names _Duck Nest_ is the most common.

### Ursa Major

In central Siberia, the name _Elk_ is used very often for this constellation
but in Eastern Siberia the name "Bear" is used more frequently.

### Orion

Of the constellation of Orion, Siberians usually use only three stars of the
belt: they are called _Kichigi_ (the Threshers). It is a typical image of the
threchers from north-eastern Russia that they stand in a row. In the European
part of Russia an asterism called _Kichigi_ usually hides the Ursa Major
constellation.
