# Ojibwe

## Introduction

Ojibwe are one of the largest groups of indigenous people of North America (United States and Canada). Please also see the "Lakota Sky Culture" which is comparable because it is a neighbouring culture. 

## Description

Depending on the region, Ojibwe are known for birch bark canoes, wildrice-_manoomin_, and maple syrup. Also known as Anishinaabe and Chippewa. The word Ojibwe means ‘cooks food outside’. The Ojibwe Star Knowledge files available for Stellarium are an adaptation of the ___“Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan, Ojibiwe Sky Star Map”___, created by A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy, 2012. More details can be found in the constellation guidebook ___Ojibwe Sky Star Map Constellation Guide: An Introduction to Ojibwe Star Knowledge___. Also available are Ojibwe star map posters, Ojibwe planispheres, curriculum, and other resources.
