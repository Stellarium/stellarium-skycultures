# Arabic (Ancient)

## Introduction

The Arabic sky culture displays the indigenous star knowledge of the ancient 
Arabs living in the Arabian Peninsula prior to the Greek astronomy influence in 
the ninth century.

## Description

The star knowledge of the ancient Arabs had been recorded and preserved in old 
poetry and in the old works of Arab philologists and lexicographers of the 
Islamic civilization. Many books were written on the subject of star knowledge 
and anwāʾ [Arabic الأنواء], the Arabic knowledge of meteorology. The 
editors of _Kitab al-Anwāʾ_ of Ibn Qutaybah (died ~ 889 AD) listed twenty-four 
books on this subject written mostly between early eighth and tenth century 
[#1]. The only completely preserved text is that of Ibn Qutaybah, but later 
scholars had quoted many of the earlier texts. One of the most significant works 
that recorded the indigenous Arab star names is _Book of the Stars_ written in ~ 
964 by the prominent astronomer: al-Ṣūfī, where he identified the indigenous 
Arab star names with the respective Ptolemaic stars of the Greek constellations 
[#4].

The source of this sky culture is a study and compilation of star knowledge of 
ancient Arabs from the books listed in the References section.

### Constellations

The ancient Arabs named single stars, two stars, an area in the sky, and 
particular shape of a group of stars. Single stars were named after a human 
figure or a desert animal, _Arcturus_ is _al-Simāk al-ramiḥ_, meaning: The 
high one with the spear. _Canopus_ is _Suhayl_, a proper name of a man. We have 
also stars named: _The caracal_ and _The kid_ (the young goat). If two stars of 
comparable brightness are close to each other, they are given a common name 
like: _The two calves_, _The two wolves_, _The two doves_.

Sometimes an area is named after a group of animals. The brighter stars are 
adult animals, and the faint ones are the young animals like: _The hyenas and 
their youngsters_, _The horses and the foals_.

Particular shapes of stars were given names like _The scorpion_, _The lion_, 
_al-Jawzāʾ_ which is a proper name of a woman for Orion stars.

Other asterisms are given names according to legends and stories.
