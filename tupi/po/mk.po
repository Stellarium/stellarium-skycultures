"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"As with many cultures, constellations were identified and used to help keep track of the seasons and predict the seasonal variations which affect daily life. In the book _Histoire de la Mission de Pères Capucins en l'Isle de Maragnan etterres circonvoisins_, published in Paris, 1614, it is stated that the Tupi people identified some thirty constellations, but the book only details seven.\n"
