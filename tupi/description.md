# Tupi-Guarani

## Introduction

Tupi-Guarani is a name given to a family of languages spoken by the indigenous
peoples of Brazil and other South American countries.

## Description

As with many cultures, constellations were identified and used to help keep
track of the seasons and predict the seasonal variations which affect daily
life. In the book _Histoire de la Mission de Pères Capucins en l'Isle de
Maragnan et terres circonvoisines_, published in Paris, 1614, it is stated that
the Tupi people identified some thirty constellations but the book only details
seven.

## Constellations

##### White Ostrich

The Tupi name for this constellation is _Iandutim_ (_Guirá Nhandu_ in Guarani),
which literally translates to _White Ostrich_. The constellation depicts a
large bird.

In the first two weeks of June this constellation is fully visible in the
Eastern sky in the evening, indicating the beginning of Winter in the South of
Brazil, and the start of the dry season in the North.

##### Old Man

This constellation depicts an old man holding a stick.

In the second half of December, the constellation is fully visible in the
Eastern evening sky. This marks the beginning of summer in the southern parts
of Brazil and the start of the rainy season in the North.
