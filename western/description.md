## Introduction

The modern sky culture is used internationally by astronomers since 1928, and is the official scheme of The International Astronomical Union. It has historical roots in Ancient Greek astronomy, with influences from Islamic astronomy.

## Description

In the 2nd century CE, Klaudios Ptolemaios (Ptolemy) in Alexandria published a multi-volume book which summarised the knowledge of the time and rooted in a tradition of mathematical astronomy since Hipparchus (at least 265 year earlier). In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century), from Arabic into Latin, and later, from the original ancient Greek into medieval Latin. Due to this transformation, it is now known under the artifical name Almagest, derived from the Arabic title.[#7]

The Almagest's star catalogue (book VII and VIII) has been depicted many times in the Islamic as well as in the Christian astronomical traditions. Often, the figures were re-drawn in order to adopt them to the taste of art of the epoch. In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names. Therefore, this sky culture displays a modern descendant of the Ptolemaic one with traces of translations, misunderstandings, transformations, and purposly additions. 

In 1603 the lawyer and hobby astronomer Johann Bayer from Augsburg, Germany, made a new celestial atlas, called Uranometria [#2]. In this atlas, he introduced a systematic naming of stars starting with alpha, the brightest, beta, the second brightest, gamma, the third ... within a consellation. Subsequently, it was established to name a star with a Greek letter and the Latin constellation name in casus genitive. 

In the 18th century, the century of great atlases (Flamsteed, Fortin, Bode: [#3][#4]), new constellations were added and filled the gaps between northern constellations. Additionally, there were suggestions to create new constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to Ptolemy.  European astronomers visited the the European colonies and instead of asking the native people for their constellations, the Europeans were creative. This way, many new technical inventions of the early modern period were depicted in constellations (e.g. a chemical machine, a balloon, an air pump) as well as exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird). 

The problem was that sometimes astronomers did not agree with each other and, thus, atlases showed deviations from each other.   

After many centuries of astronomers taking liberties in interpretation of the Ptolemaic original, there were many variants of constellations. As constellations are a positioning system, i.e. astronomers describe positions in the sky relative to stars and stars relative to constellations (like "Betelgeuse", Orion's right shoulder), it is necessary to use constellation names and star names uniformly all over the world. 

In the "Fin de siècle", there were upcoming suggestions in the IAU to unify the system of constellations and star names [#5].  

As the IAU in 1928 only defined the boundaries of these areas [#4] and not the way of drawing artwork within them, several sub-cultures of painting figures and drawing simplified stickfigures were developed during the 20th and 21st century. We provide some of them as further sky cultures. 

### Constellations 

These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in the Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint stars belonging to no constellation.[#8] In the Modern Epoch, several astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps (e.g. the constellation of "the lynx" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them), among them many political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU aimed for a huge clean-up. 

In 1922, the IAU officially accepted the list of 88 constellation names and their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining political constellations is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without mentioning the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. In 1928, he finished the work and the IAU accepted his delimitations [#1]. 

These "constellations" are naked areas in the sky without any stick figures or depictions [#5]. The borders simply follow the lines of right ascension and declination. These constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.

Stellarium by default displays the precise RA-DEC-boundaries and a set of artwork constellations on the basis of Ptolemaic figures but following our contemporary taste of art. 

### Proper names of stars

Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table: 

----------------------------
| description of the star's position in the figure | ecliptical | coordinates  | magnitude | 
|------|----|----|----|
|      |λ | β | mag | 
| e.g. | | | |
| the star at the tip of the tail of Ursa Minor | Gem 0 1/6 | +66 | 3 | 

In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g. first astronomer abbreviated in a text "tip of the tail", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and wrote only "tail" next to the star and this name remained. With centuries, these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases the translators or writers make mistakes because of misreading or misspelling or the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic "yad al gauza", the hand of the giant woman, to the common term "Betelgeuse"). 

However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star "Antares", the counterpart of Ares (Mars) and even a few original Babylonian terms like "Shargaz", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most recent IAU star names [#6] are a huge mixture, also with influences or even politically wanted additions of star names from the none-Ptolemaic sky cultures, e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in Hydra (its meaning is only "star", a reminescence to his lonely position) or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.
