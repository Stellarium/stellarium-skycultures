"For years, Hawaiian navigators have memorized the position of stars as they\n"
"rise and set in order to know oneʻs bearing. Wayfinder Nainoa Thompson (born\n"
"1953, Hawaii) is a graduated navigator and famous for being the first Hawaiian\n"
"to practice Polynesian art of navigation since the 14th century with a\n"
"double-hulled canoe. He developed a system of organization to help memorize the\n"
"position of stars throughout the celestial sphere by dividing the sky into four\n"
"evenly sized star lines. This system roots in ancient Hawaiian constellations\n"
"which he had got to know during his studies.\n"
"\n"
"### History\n"
"\n"
"The knowledge of Hawaiian star navigation has been passed down orally for many\n"
"generations. Much of the knowledge regarding stars and navigation were lost\n"
"until the Hawaiian Renaissance in the early 1970s. Polynesian Voyage Society\n"
"(PVS), founded in 1973, created Hokule’a in 1975. Hokule’a is a traditional\n"
"Hawaiian voyaging canoe with the mission to revive the art of way finding. A\n"
"man from Satawal, Micronesia named Mau Piailug was a master\n"
"navigator/wayfinder. The knowledge of wayfinding and using the sky to navigate\n"
"was passed down to Mau from his ancestors. Nainoa Thompson, current President\n"
"of PVS, asked Mau to teach his knowledge of navigation to him with the\n"
"intention of reviving the knowledge that was once lost to the Hawaiians. With\n"
"the knowledge learned from Mau, the Hawaiian star compass and star lines were\n"
"created.\n"
"\n"
"### Star Lines\n"
"\n"
"Each star line is a group of main stars that will be remembered by the\n"
"navigators. The stars connect making constellations. Navigators remember the\n"
"rising/setting houses of these stars, the stars that connect in each line, and\n"
"the lines that point directly to North and South. The star lines’ position in\n"
"the night sky slowly change over time, each starline being more prevalent at\n"
"night according to the season. The star lines with their according season are\n"
"as follows:\n"
"\n"
"| Native Name        | Season               |\n"
"|--------------------|----------------------|\n"
"| _Ke Ka o Makali‘i_ | November to April    |\n"
"| _Ka Iwikuamo‘o_    | April to July        |\n"
"| _Manaiakalani_     | May to October       |\n"
"| _Ka Lupe o Kawelo_ | September to February|\n"
"\n"
"### Background and Acknowledgements\n"
"\n"
"The _master navigator_ behind this sky culture was Mau Piailug of Satawal, who\n"
"taught the Polynesian art of celestial navigation to Nainoa Thompson, who\n"
"developed this version of the sky culture that was used from 2013-17 by\n"
"Hawaiians to sail around the world during the Malama Honua Voyage of Hokule’a,\n"
"the Polynesian voyaging canoe. Stellarium has been used as a tool by the\n"
"navigators of Hokule’a and this sky culture serves as a tool for practicing\n"
"Polynesian navigation.\n"
"\n"
"The technical implementation of the sky culture included here was contributed\n"
"in 2017 by teachers Darren Kamalu and Christopher Blake, Students Jonah Apo,\n"
"Nicholas Koanui, Brenden Aila and the Celestial Navigation class at Kamehameha\n"
"Schools Kapalama, Honolulu, Hawai’i. Artwork by Kealoha Kaneakua."

# Description of Hawaiian constellation The Canoe Bailer of Makali`i
msgid ""
"The direct translation means the “Canoe Bailer of Makali’i”. The lines are\n"
"shaped as a canoe bailer which scoops _Ka Hei-Hei o Na Keiki_ (Orion) and\n"
"_Makali’i_ (Pleiades) up into the night sky. In voyaging a bailer is used to\n"
"scoop up water out of the hulls.\n"
"\n"
"The main stars of _Ke Ka o Makali’i_ from North to South are _Hokulei_\n"
"(Capella), _Nanamua_ (Castor), _Nanahope_ (Pollux), _Puana_ (Procyon), and\n"
"_‘A’a_ (Sirius). These stars connect together to create the bailer in the sky.\n"
"Mintaka in Orion is an important star in this line because it rises/sets\n"
"directly east or west giving the navigator an easy pointer star for direction.\n"
"Mirzim (next to _‘A’a_ (Sirius)) and _Ke Ali’i Kona i Ka Lewa_ (Canopus)\n"
"connect together to create a southern pointer. _‘Ekekeuehuehu_ (θ Aur, Mahasim)\n"
"and _‘Ekekeu’ena’ena_ (β Aur, Menkalinan) connect to create a northern pointer.\n"
"Different north/south pointers are found in the star lines and used heavily by\n"
"navigators."

"_Ka Iwikuamo’o_ translates to the backbone (directly: Bone back-lizard). This\n"
"star line is depicted as the backbone of a lizard or _mo’o_ in this sky\n"
"culture. It can also be representing a genealogical backbone, each star\n"
"representing a generation.\n"
"\n"
"The star line itself starts with _Hokupa’a_ (North Star), the ultimate northern\n"
"pointer due to the star never moving in the sky, always above north. _Hokupa’a_\n"
"connects down to _Na Hiku_ (Big Dipper). _Na Hiku_ translates to “The Seven” as\n"
"there is seven stars in the Big Dipper. _Hokule’a_ (Arcturus) and _Hikianalia_\n"
"(Spica) are the two stars in the middle of the star line. The two PVS canoes\n"
"are named after these two stars. _Hokule’a_ is the “zenith” star of Hawai’i,\n"
"meaning it will be directly overhead when you are at the latitude of the\n"
"Hawaiian Islands. _Hokule’a_ is very important to navigators on finding their\n"
"way back to Hawai’i. The meaning of _Hokule’a_ is “the star of gladness”\n"
"because it is the star used to find home bringing joy. Next to _Hikianalia_ is\n"
"_Me’e_, a combination of four stars that create a box. _Me’e_ connects down to\n"
"_Hanaiakamalama_ (Southern Cross) which is the southern pointer for _Ka\n"

"_Manaiakalani_ translates to “The Chief's Fishline”. This refers to the legend\n"
"of the demi god Maui and his fish hook. Maui is credited for pulling up the\n"
"islands with his magical fish hook.\n"
"\n"
"This star line consists of two constellations. The Navigator’s Triangle on the\n"
"north and Maui’s fish hook on the south. The Navigator’s Triangle is made of\n"
"three stars _Hawaiki_ (Deneb), _Keoe_ (Vega), and _Humu_ (Altair). (It is the\n"
"same figure as the Summer Triangle for modern amateur astronomers.) These stars\n"
"also represent the Polynesian triangle: Hawai’i (_Hawaiki_), Rapanui (_Keoe_),\n"
"and Aotearoa (_Humu_). These three islands are pulled by the fish hook of Maui\n"
"(Scorpius).\n"
"\n"
"The northern pointer is found in the Navigator’s Triangle when you connect\n"
"_Hawaiki_ (Deneb) and _Momonapikowalu_ (γ Cyg, Sadr). Southern pointers are in\n"
"the fish hook when you connect _Mili’opu_ (δ Sco, Dschubba) and _Kahe_ (π Sco,\n"

"_Ka Lupe o Kawelo_ translates to “The Kite of Kawelo”. Kawelo was a great chief\n"
"of Kaua’i and O’ahu and this star line represents the kite which was lost as a\n"
"child.\n"
"\n"
"The star line starts with _‘Iwakeli’i_, meaning Chief Frigate Bird (_Fregata\n"
"Minor_). The shape of this constellation (which is Cassiopeia's W in the West)\n"
"resembles the _‘iwa_ bird that is known for leading voyagers to land. The\n"
"center of the star line is the Kite of Kawelo (equal to the Great Square of\n"
"Pegasus). The four stars that make the kite are named after Kawelo’s greatest\n"
"ancestors: _Manokalanipo_ (δ Peg, Alpheratz), _Kakuhihewa_ (β Peg, Scheat),\n"
"_Pi’ilani_ (γ Peg, Algenib), and _Keawe_ (α Peg, Markab). All four were famous\n"
"chiefs of their time. The star line then connects south to two stars _Pi’ikea_\n"
"(β Cet, Deneb Kaitos) and _Kukaniloko_ (α PsA, Fomalhaut).\n"
"\n"
"The northern pointer is found in _Manokalanipo_ (δ Peg, Alpheratz) and\n"
"_Kealohalani-po-keao_ (β Cas, Caph) of _‘Iwakeli’i_. The southern pointer is\n"
