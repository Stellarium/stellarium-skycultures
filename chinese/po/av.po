"### Asterisms (Xingguans)\n"
"\n"
"In traditional Chinese astronomy stars are grouped to form asterisms, known as\n"
"\"Xingguan\" (Chinese: 星官, xīngguān, meaning \"Star officials\"). Xinguuans have\n"
"names and shapes related to elements of the ancient Chinese society such as the\n"
"kingdom, the mountains, the goods or the industry. They are in a way projecting\n"
"the world of humans into the sky.\n"
"\n"
"Xingguans can contain from one to several dozens of stars. Most of them\n"
"are smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. In the Song\n"
"dynasty (13th century), the Suzhou astronomical map [#3] was engraved in\n"
"marble. It shows a total of 283 Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,565\n"
"individual stars divided into 31 regions: the 28 lunar mansions along the\n"
"ecliptic, and the 3 enclosures of the northern sky.\n"
"\n"
"![](suzhouskxt.webp)\n"
"The astronomical map of Suzhou, engraved in black marble (1247)\n"
"{: .img_and_caption }\n"
"\n"
"Due to precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon became difficult to\n"
"observe and were not included in the Suzhou map. Before the Ming dynasty,\n"
"Xingguans did not include the sky around the celestial south pole. The Southern\n"
"Asterisms were added as a fifth group in the late Ming dynasty based on\n"
"European star charts, defining an additional 23 Xingguans [#11].\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"For ancient Chinese, the Sun, the Moon and the five planets form _Seven\n"
"Luminaries_ (Chinese: 七曜, qīyào), which correspond to the Yin, the Yang and the\n"
"Five Elements. The wood is green, the fire is red, the earth is yellow, the\n"
"metal is white, the water is black. So, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is\n"
"named Metal Star, Mars is named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star,\n"
"Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"The Sun and the Moon are named Taiyang (Sun, Chinese: 太阳) and Taiyin (Moon,\n"
"Chinese: 太阴) composed from the words \"tài\" (Great, Chinese: 太) and \"Yin\" or\n"
"\"Yang\". Their other name belongs to pictographic characters Ri (Sun, Chinese:\n"
"日) and Yue (Moon, Chinese: 月) but the more commonly used name for the moon is\n"
"Yueliang (Chinese: 月亮, yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"The naming of stars in ancient China is composed of the name of the Xingguan\n"
"plus a number. Some stars also have a common name, such as Alpha Leonis which\n"
"is called \"the Queen's Star\".\n"
"\n"
"Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star names are still in common usage\n"
"today, even more common than Bayer/Flamsteed designations.\n"
"\n"
"### The three Enclosures\n"
"\n"
"The 3 enclosures are regions containing smaller asterisms. The enclosure of the\n"
"Purple Forbidden Palace (Chinese: 紫微垣, Zǐwēi yuán) surrounds almost the whole\n"
"circumpolar area while the enclosures of the Supreme Palace (Chinese: 太微垣,\n"
"Tàiwēi yuán) and the Heavenly Market (Chinese: 天市垣, Tiānshì yuán) are located\n"
"close to the ecliptic.\n"
"\n"
"Each enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which are\n"
"the main Xingguans. Some Xingguans are located within these \"wall\" (such as\n"
"Guards of the Palace), others are located in the area that they are\n"
"surrounding. For example, the Xingguans of the Emperor and of the Crown Prince\n"
"are located inside the Xingguan of the Forbidden Palace.\n"
"\n"
"The enclosure of Purple Forbidden Palace [#7] represents the inner palace of\n"
"the emperor because the whole celestial sphere with all other Xingguans is\n"
"turning around this polar region. In the ancient Chinese belief, the Purple\n"
"Forbidden Palace lies in the middle of the sky and covers the modern\n"
"constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga,\n"
"Boötes, and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. It\n"
"contains 37 traditional Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"The enclosure of the Supreme Palace [#8] is the place where the emperor and the\n"
"courtiers deal with their politics. The Supreme Palace includes a variety of\n"
"officials and government agencies, a total of 20 traditional Xingguans. It\n"
"covers the modern constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of\n"
"Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor.\n"
"\n"
"Heavenly Market enclosure [#9] is a bazaar in the sky, a place where ordinary\n"
"people meet and are represented with their bazaar facilities in 19 Xingguans.\n"
"The Heavenly Market Place covers the modern constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus,\n"
"Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules.\n"
"\n"
"### Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions\n"
"\n"
"The 28 Lunar Mansions (Chinese: 宿, xiù) [#10] are slices of right ascensions in\n"
"the path of the Moon around the ecliptic. The lunar mansion asterisms are not\n"
"of equal size: there are 28 constellations north and south of the ecliptic but\n"
"the regions of the Xiú (mansions) extend from there towards the equatorial pole\n"
"where the right ascension lines intersect. The inital intention was to define\n"
"the mansions in a way so that the Moon changes of mansion every day but due to\n"
"variability of the orbit and speed of the Moon, this concept does not apply any\n"
"more. The smallest slice extends on only 1° of right ascension."

"### Notes on star names\n"
"\n"
"There can be more than one way of numbering the stars within one\n"
"asterism, thus, there can be more than one \"name\" for a certain star. For\n"
"example, \"the Queen's Star\" is also referred to as \"Xuanyuan 14\" or (rarely)\n"
"\"Xuanyuan 1\". The number depending on the purpose (normal astronomy or\n"
"observation of the Moon's path).\n"
"\n"
"In the traditional Chinese catalogues before 1650, coordinates were only given\n"
"for one star per constellation, the so called main star or principle star [#1].\n"
"This is the star with the number \"1\" in the constellation where counting is\n"
"started. It is usually the star with the westernmost right ascension.\n"
"\n"
"The Suzhou map [#3] is based on coordinates and asterisms defined in antiquity\n"
"which became canonical [#1],[#2] but later further stars were added. These are\n"
"called \"added stars\" (Chinese: 增星, zēng xīng) while the stars from the\n"
"original catalogue are called \"proper stars\" (Chinese: 正星, zhèng xīng).\n"
"\n"
"_The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 3240\n"
"Stars names in total. Yi Shitong has conducted textual research and summary of\n"
"these records in his book _Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and\n"
"Catalogue 1950.0_ (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表 1950.0, Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo).\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"### Notes on Lunar Mansion\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese coordinates are given in \"degrees right ascension\" within a\n"
"lunar mansion. The star where the measurement starts for this lunar mansion is\n"
"called the determinative star (Chinese: 距星, jùxīng) of the mansions. The\n"
"equatorial degrees of the lodge (Chinese: 宿度, xiùdù) are all right ascensions\n"
"between the determinative star of a mansion the determinative star of the next\n"
"one. However, the traditional Chinese right ascension \"degrees\" are smaller\n"
"than in the sexagesimal system we are used to because the traditional Chinese\n"
"\"degrees\" reflect the motion of the mean Sun as one degree per day. Thus, a\n"
"Chinese \"degree\" is not 1/360 of the full circle but 1/365.25 of the circle.\n"
"\n"
"The 28 mansion asterisms are grouped into Four Holy Beasts (Chinese: 象, xiàng),\n"
"each containing seven mansions corresponding to seven luminaries. The Four Holy\n"
"Beasts are the White Tiger of the East, The Red Bird of the South, the Azure\n"
"Dragon of the West and the Dark Warrier of the North. As they all lay around\n"
"the ecliptic, the association with the compass direction does not correspond to\n"
"the real horizon.\n"

"### The Southern Asterisms\n"
"\n"
"The sky around the south celestial pole was unknown to ancient Chinese.\n"
"Therefore, it was not included in the Three Enclosures and Twenty-Eight\n"
"Mansions system. However, by the end of the Ming Dynasty, Xu Guangqi\n"
"(Chinese:徐光启, Xú Guāngqǐ) introduced another 23 Xingguans based on the\n"
"knowledge of European star charts. These Xingguans were since incorporated into\n"
"the traditional Chinese star maps.\n"
