"Stellarium currently provides roughly 300 Chinese asterisms, called Xingguan (Chinese: 星官; pinyin: xīngguān, meaning: Star officials), and is without any Chinese star names. A project conducted by community member G.S.K.Lee is now underway to construct a complete Chinese sky culture set for Stellarium based on the information inside _Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ (Chinese: 仪象考成; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng), an imperial record of astronomy finished in 1756. It was revised in 1844, published _The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ (Chinese: 仪象考成续编; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng xùbiān), which is the major reference to the traditional Chinese Xingguans and star names used today.\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"In western astronomy, the planets are named after gods. The ancient Chinese understanding of five planets is based on five-element concepts. The wood is green, the fire is red, the earth is yellow, the metal is white, the water is black. So, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is named Metal Star, Mars is named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star, Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"In Chinese, the Sun and the Moon are named after Yin and Yang (which contain \"great (Chinese:太, pinyin:tài)\"), respectively Taiyang (Sun, Chinese:太阳) and Taiyin (Moon. Chinese: 太阴, pinyin: tàiyīn). Their other name belongs to pictographic characters Ri (Sun, Chinese:日) and Yue (Moon, Chinese:月) but the more commonly used name for the moon is Yueliang (Chinese:月亮, pinyin: yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"The Sun, the Moon and the five planets form Seven Luminaries (Chinese:七曜,pinyin:qīyào), which correspond to the Five Elements and Yin and Yang.\n"
"\n"
"### Xingguans (asterisms)\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of grouping stars to asterisms or constellations, known as \"Xingguan\". Their names and layout are very social, concerning the kingdom, the mountains, the goods, the industry in order to project everything of the world of humans into the sky.\n"
"\n"
"Most Xingguans are smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. In the Song dynasty (13th century), the Suzhou astronomical map was engraved in marble. It shows a total of 283 Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,565 individual stars. The Xingguan are divided into 31 regions, i.e. the 28 lunar mansions along the ecliptic, and the 3 enclosures of the northern sky. Due to precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon became difficult to see and were not included.\n"
"\n"
"Before the Ming dynasty, Xingguans did not include the sky around the celestial south pole. The Southern Asterisms were added as a fifth group in the late Ming dynasty based on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"_Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 300 Xingguans in total.\n"
"\n"
"Modern constellations refer to specific areas of the celestial sphere. Xingguans refer only to the way stars are distributed, with no specific boundaries between Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"A Xingguan can contain from one to several dozens of stars. The so called single star asterisms among the Xingguans can be treated like star names. In Xingguan of two or more stars, each star has a number; the naming of stars in ancient China is the name of the Xingguan plus a number. However, there can be more than one way of numbering the stars within one asterism, thus, there can be more than one \"name\" for a certain star.\n"
"\n"
"Very few stars of the Xingguans have proper name additional to their number, e.g. alpha Leonis has the Chinese name \"the Queen's Star\" and is also referred to as \"Xuanyuan 14\" or (rarely) \"Xuanyuan 1\". The counting depends on the purpose (normal astronomy or observation of the Moon's path). \n"
"\n"
"In the traditional Chinese catalogues before 1650, coordinates were only given for one star per constellation, the so called main star or principle star [#1]. This is the star with the number \"1\" in the constellation where counting is started. It is usually the star with the westernmost right ascension. \n"
"\n"
"The Suzhou map  [#3] is based on coordinates and asterisms defined in antiquity which became canonical [#1],[#2] but later further stars were \"added stars\" (Chinese: 增星, pinyin:zēng xīng). The stars of the original catalogue are called \"proper stars\" (Chinese: 正星, pinyin: zhèng xīng). \n"
"\n"
"_The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical Instruments_ has 3240 Stars names in total. Yi Shitong has conducted textual research and summary of these records in his book _Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0_ (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表 1950.0; pinyin: Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo).\n"
"\n"
"Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star names are still in common usage today, even more common than Bayer/Flamsteed designations.\n"

"\n"
"### Three Enclosures\n"
"\n"
"The 3 enclosures are regions which are summarizing many smaller asterisms. The enclosure of the Purple Forbidden Palace (Chinese: 紫微垣, pinyin: Zǐwēi yuán) surrounds almost the whole circumpolar area while the enclosures of the Supreme Palace (Chinese: 太微垣, pinyin: Tàiwēi yuán) and the Heavenly Market Place (Chinese: 天市垣, pinyin: Tiānshì yuán) are located close to the ecliptic.\n"
"\n"
"Each enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which are the main xingguans. There are Xingguans at these \"wall\" asterisms (such as guards of the palace) as well as within the area that they are surrounding, e.g. within the Forbidden Palace xingguan, there are the xingguans of the Emperor, the Crown Prince and other. \n"
"\n"
"The Purple Forbidden Palace represents the inner palace of the emperor because the whole celestial sphere with all other xingguans is turning around this polar region. Thus, in the ancient Chinese belief, the Purple Forbidden Palace lies in the middle of the sky and covers the modern constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, Boötes, and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. It contains 37 traditional xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"*   [Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Forbidden_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"The enclosure of the Supreme Palace is the place where the emperor and the courtiers deal with their politics. The Supreme Palace includes a variety of officials and government agencies, a total of 20 traditional Xingguans. It covers the modern constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor.\n"
"\n"
"*   [Supreme Palace Enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Palace_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"Heavenly Market Enclosure is a bazaar in the sky, a place where ordinary people meet and are represented with their bazaar facilities in 19 xingguans. The Heavenly Market Place covers the modern constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus, Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules. \n"

"### Twenty-Eight Mansions (Xiù)\n"
"\n"
"The 28 Lunar Mansions (Chinese: 宿, pinyin: xiù) are slices of right ascensions that are bases in the path of the Moon ±5° around the ecliptic. The lunar mansion asterisms are not of equal size, they are 28 constellations north and south of the ecliptic but the regions of the Xiú (mansions) extend from there towards the equatorial pole where the right ascension lines intersect. The inital intention was to define the mansions in a way that the Moon changes the mansion every day but due to variability of the orbit and speed of the Moon, this concept does not apply any more. The smallest slice is only 1° right ascension. \n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese coordinates are given in \"degrees right ascension\" within a lunar mansion. The star where the measurement starts for this lunar mansion is called the determinative star (Chinese: 距星, pinyin: jùxīng) of the mansions. The equatorial degrees of the lodge (Chinese: 宿度, pinyin: xiùdù) are all right ascensions between the determinative star of a mansion the determinative star of the next one. However, the traditional Chinese right ascension \"degrees\" are smaller than in the sexagesimal system we are used to because the traditional Chinese \"degrees\" reflect the motion of the mean Sun as one degree per day. Thus, a Chinese \"degree\" is not 1/360 of the full circle but 1/365.25 of the circle. \n"
"\n"
"The 28 mansion asterisms are grouped into Four Holy Beasts (Chinese: 象 pinyin: xiàng), each containing seven mansions corresponding to seven luminaries. The Four Holy Beasts are the White Tiger of the East, The Red Bird of the South, the Azure Dragon of the West and the Dark Warrier of the North. As they all lay around the ecliptic, the association with the compass direction does not correspond to the real horizon.\n"

"The sky around the south celestial pole was unknown to ancient Chinese. Therefore, it was not included in the Three Enclosures and Twenty-Eight Mansions system. However, by the end of the Ming Dynasty, Xu Guangqi (Chinese:徐光启,pinyin:Xú Guāngqǐ) introduced another 23 Xingguans based on the knowledge of European star charts.

"\n"
"### الشمس والقمر والكواكب\n"
"\n"
"في علم الفلك الغربي ، سميت الكواكب باسم الآلهة. يعتمد الفهم الصيني القديم لخمس كواكب على مفاهيم من خمسة عناصر. الخشب أخضر ، والنار أحمر ، والأرض أصفر ، والمعدن أبيض ، والماء أسود. لذلك ، يدعى ميركوري ووتر ستار ، فينوس يدعى ميتال ستار ، المريخ يدعى فاير ستار ، المشتري يدعى وود ستار ، زحل يدعى إيرث ستار.\n"
"\n"
"في الصينية ، تمت تسمية الشمس والقمر باسم Yin و Yang (التي تحتوي على \"عظيم (صيني: 太 ، pinyin: tài)\") ، على التوالي Taiyang (Sun ، صيني: 太阳) و Taiyin (Moon. صيني: 太阴 ، pinyin : tàiyīn). ينتمي اسمهم الآخر إلى شخصيات تصويرية Ri (Sun، Chinese: 日) و Yue (Moon، Chinese: 月) ولكن الاسم الأكثر استخدامًا للقمر هو Yueliang (بالصينية: 月亮 ، pinyin: yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"تشكل الشمس والقمر والكواكب الخمسة Seven Luminaries (بالصينية: 七曜 ، pinyin: qīyào) ، والتي تتوافق مع العناصر الخمسة و Yin و Yang.\n"
"\n"
"### Xingguans (النجوم)\n"
"\n"
"يحتوي علم الفلك الصيني التقليدي على نظام تجميع النجوم إلى النجوم أو الأبراج ، والمعروف باسم \"Xingguan\". إن أسماءهم وتخطيطهم اجتماعيون للغاية ، فيما يتعلق بالمملكة والجبال والسلع والصناعة من أجل إبراز كل شيء من عالم البشر في السماء.\n"
"\n"
"معظم Xingguans أصغر من الأبراج من التقاليد الهلنستية. في سلالة سونغ (القرن الثالث عشر) ، كانت خريطة سوتشو الفلكية محفورة في الرخام. يظهر ما مجموعه 283 Xingguans ، تضم ما مجموعه 1،565 نجمة فردية. تنقسم Xingguan إلى 31 منطقة ، أي 28 قصرًا على طول مسير الشمس ، ومرفقات 3 من السماء الشمالية. بسبب الاستباقية ، أصبح من الصعب رؤية ستة Xingguans بالقرب من الأفق الجنوبي ولم يتم تضمينها.\n"
"\n"
"قبل سلالة مينغ ، لم تشمل Xingguans السماء حول القطب الجنوبي السماوي. تم إضافة النجوم الجنوبية كمجموعة خامسة في أواخر عهد أسرة مينغ استنادًا إلى مخططات النجوم الأوروبية ، والتي تضم 23 Xingguans إضافية.\n"
"\n"
"_ دراسات مكتملة للآلات الفلكية _ لديها 300 Xingguans في المجموع.\n"
"\n"
"تشير الأبراج الحديثة إلى مناطق محددة من الكرة السماوية. تشير Xingguans فقط إلى طريقة توزيع النجوم ، بدون حدود محددة بين Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"### أسماء النجوم\n"
"\n"
"يمكن أن تحتوي Xingguan على واحد إلى عدة عشرات من النجوم. يمكن معاملة ما يسمى بعلامات النجوم النجمية بين Xingguans مثل أسماء النجوم. في Xingguan من نجمين أو أكثر ، لكل نجم رقم ؛ تسمية النجوم في الصين القديمة هو اسم Xingguan بالإضافة إلى رقم. ومع ذلك ، يمكن أن يكون هناك أكثر من طريقة لترقيم النجوم داخل نجم واحد ، وبالتالي ، يمكن أن يكون هناك أكثر من \"اسم\" لنجم معين.\n"
"\n"
"عدد قليل جدًا من نجوم Xingguans لديهم اسم مناسب بالإضافة إلى عددهم ، على سبيل المثال alpha Leonis تحمل الاسم الصيني \"Queen's Star\" ويشار إليها أيضًا باسم \"Xuanyuan 14\" أو (نادرًا) \"Xuanyuan 1\". يعتمد العد على الغرض (علم الفلك العادي أو مراقبة مسار القمر).\n"
"\n"
"في الكتالوجات الصينية التقليدية قبل عام 1650 ، تم إعطاء الإحداثيات فقط لنجمة واحدة لكل كوكبة ، ما يسمى بالنجم الرئيسي أو النجم الرئيسي [#1]. هذا هو النجم الذي يحمل الرقم \"1\" في الكوكبة حيث يبدأ العد. عادة ما يكون النجم ذو الصعود الأيمن الغربي.\n"
"\n"
"تستند خريطة سوتشو [#3] إلى إحداثيات وعلامات نجمية عُرفت في العصور القديمة والتي أصبحت أساسية [#1] ، [#2] ولكن لاحقًا أصبحت النجوم \"نجوم مضافة\" (الصينية: 增 星 ، بينيين: zēng xīng). تسمى نجوم الكتالوج الأصلي \"النجوم المناسبة\" (بالصينية: 正 星 ، pinyin: zhèng xīng).\n"

"28 القصور القمرية (الصينية: 宿 ، بينيين: xi x) هي شرائح من الصعود الأيمن والتي هي قواعد في مسار القمر ± 5 ° حول مسير الشمس. ليست كواكب القصر القمرية متساوية الحجم ، فهي 28 كوكبة شمال وجنوب مسير الشمس ولكن مناطق Xiú (القصور) تمتد من هناك نحو القطب الاستوائي حيث تتقاطع خطوط الصعود اليمنى. كان القصد الأساسي هو تحديد القصور بطريقة يغير فيها القمر القصر كل يوم ولكن نظرًا لتغير مدار وسرعة القمر ، فإن هذا المفهوم لم يعد ينطبق. الشريحة الأصغر هي الصعود الأيمن 1 درجة فقط.\n"
"\n"
"يتم إعطاء الإحداثيات الصينية التقليدية في \"درجات اليمين الصعود\" داخل قصر قمري. النجم الذي يبدأ فيه القياس لهذا القصر القمري يسمى النجم الحاسم (الصينية: 距 星 ، pinyin: jùxīng) في القصور. الدرجات الاستوائية للمنتجع (بالصينية: 宿 度 ، pinyin: xiùdù) هي كل الارتفاعات الصحيحة بين النجم الحاسم للقصر النجم الحاسم للنجم التالي. ومع ذلك ، فإن \"الدرجات\" الصينية التقليدية \"الصعود\" هي أصغر مما كانت عليه في النظام الستيني الذي اعتدنا عليه لأن \"الدرجات\" الصينية التقليدية تعكس حركة الشمس المتوسطة بدرجة واحدة في اليوم. وبالتالي ، فإن \"الدرجة\" الصينية ليست 1/360 من الدائرة الكاملة ولكن 1 / 365.25 من الدائرة.\n"

"كانت السماء حول القطب السماوي الجنوبي غير معروفة للصينيين القدماء. لذلك ، لم يتم تضمينه في نظام الأسوار الثلاثة والقصر الثامن والعشرون. ومع ذلك ، بحلول نهاية سلالة مينغ ، قدم Xu Guangqi (بالصينية: 徐光启 ، pinyin: Xú Guāngqǐ) 23 Xingguans أخرى بناءً على معرفة مخططات النجوم الأوروبية. تم دمج هؤلاء Xingguans منذ ذلك الحين في خرائط النجوم الصينية التقليدية.\n"

"### ملاحظات\n"
"\n"
"تعتمد ثقافة السماء هذه على المعلومات الموجودة في مخطط النجوم الصينية والغربية والتباين النجمي وكتالوج النجوم 1950.0_ (كتالوج النجوم). (صيني: 中西 对照 恒星 图表 1950.0 (星 表 分册)) _ و _دراسات كاملة للأدوات الفلكية _ (صيني: 仪 象 考 成).\n"
"\n"
"شكر خاص لـ Liu Chunbin على تجميع مخطط النجوم الصينية والغربية للتباين و Star Catalog 1950.0 (Star Catalog) _. أنتج كتالوج النجم الصيني للنجمية (الصينية: ستيلاريوم ell 星 官 体系 下 中文 星 名 扩展 包) هو مرجع مهم للغاية.\n"
"\n"
"لترجمة الأبراج ، أنتج استخدام متحف هونغ كونغ للفضاء مسرد إنجليزي-صيني لمناطق النجوم الصينية والعلامات النجمية وأسماء النجوم (صيني: 中国 星 区 、 星 官 及 星 名 英译 表). يتم تغيير جزء صغير فقط من الترجمة ، على سبيل المثال ، ترجمة اثنين من Xingguans مختلفة هي نفسها.\n"
"\n"
"لا يمكن تفسير الدلالات الثقافية للاسم بشكل مثالي ، نظرًا لأن آلاف السنين مرت ، فإن الدلالات وراء بعض الأسماء مثيرة للجدل. هذه فقط ترجمات محتملة."
