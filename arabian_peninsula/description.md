# Arabian Peninsula

## Introduction

The oral folk tradition of star names and asterisms in the Arabian Peninsula, 
mostly scattered in poetry and proverbs.

## Description

The Bedouins and farmers in central Arabia relied heavily on stars for timing 
their nomadic trips, animal care, weather forecast and agricultural activities. 
We find frequent mention of stars in their proverbs and poetry. Fortunately, the 
oral poetry and proverbs have been documented and preserved in collections by 
different scholars. Surveying these collections along with oral traditions 
reveals the star knowledge of the people of this region.

The stars used for timing are the same as that of ancient Arabs, but the system 
is simplified by beginning the year cycle with the heliacal rising of 
al-Thurayya, the Pleiades, in the beginning of summer, and then counting 13 days 
for each lunar station, except for al-Jabhah that has 14 days. This will have 27 
lunar stations x 13 days + 14 days for (al-Jabhah) = 365-day cycle. Other 
methods of timing were also used like the monthly Pleiades-Moon conjunction or 
using other stars like the stars of the Big Dipper.

The sources show that star names and asterisms are few compared to that of 
ancient Arabs. Only the bright stars and prominent asterism were named and used. 
An important source of star knowledge that continued its influence up to the 
present is the poetry of al-Khalāwī, a poet who's time is not certain but 
estimated to be in the 17th century[#9]. Another important source is a poem by 
Moḥammad al-Qādhī (~1809 -1886), where he described all the 28 lunar 
stations, citing them by the local names[#8].

The source of this sky culture is a compilation of star names from oral 
traditions and the books listed in the references section.

## Constellations

##### The two guards - The two refugees - Āl Abā Bzay

The two stars: β UMi and γ UMi. They are used for directions. _The Two Guards_ 
comes from the legend that al-Jady (Polaris) killed the father of the seven 
sisters who are carrying the bier of their father (The stars of the Big Dipper) 
and circling al-Jady, vowing that they will not burry their father until they 
get revenge. Al-Jady asked these two for protection, and the name is _The two 
guards_.

The other name _The two refugees_ comes from another version of the legend that 
they are the ones who committed the killing and they fled towards al-Jady for 
protection.

These two names are common throughout the central region of Saudi Arabia.

Āl Abā Bzay is another name of β UMi and γ UMi, meaning: the family of Abā
