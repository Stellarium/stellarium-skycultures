# Arabian Peninsula

## Introduction
The oral folk tradition of star names and asterisms in the Arabian Peninsula, mostly scattered in poetry and proverbs.

## Description
The Bedouins and farmers in central Arabia relied heavily on stars for timing their nomadic trips, animal care, weather forecast and agricultural activities. We find frequent mention of stars in their proverbs and poetry. Fortunately, the oral poetry and proverbs have been documented and preserved in collections by different scholars. Surveying these collections along with oral traditions reveals the star knowledge of the people of this region.

The stars used for timing are the same as that of ancient Arabs, but the system is simplified by beginning the year cycle with the heliacal rising of al-Thurayya, the Pleiades, in the beginning of summer, and then counting 13 days for each lunar station, except for al-Jabhah that has 14 days. This will have 27 lunar stations x 13 days + 14 days (al-Jabhah) = 365-day cycle. Other methods of timing were also used like the monthly Pleiades-Moon conjunction or using other stars like the stars of the Big Dipper.

The sources show that star names and asterisms are few compared to that of ancient Arabs. Only the bright stars and prominent asterism were named and used. An important source of star knowledge that continued its influence up to the present is the poetry of al-Khalāwī, a poet who's time is not certain but estimated to be in the 17th century[^1]. Another important source is a poem by Moḥammad al-Qādhī (~1809 -1886), where he described all the 28 lunar stations, citing them by the local names[^2].
