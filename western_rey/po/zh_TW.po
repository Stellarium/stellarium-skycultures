"During the 19th century the use and further editions of richly illustrated\n"
"atlases with sumptuously engraved mythological figures fell out of fashion. The\n"
"stars of the constellations in atlases of that time started to be shown\n"
"connected with line patterns (\"stickfigures\"), which however appear sometimes\n"
"only to have been used to indicate which stars belong to which constellation.\n"
"\n"
"Over several decades the figures had ceased to resemble the figures they were\n"
"named after and appeared incomprehensible to beginning stargazers in the middle\n"
"of the 20th century. H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977), an artist\n"
"and author of children's books of German descent but emigrated to the USA,\n"
"published his answer to this problem in 1952 with the book _The Stars - A New\n"
"Way To See Them_ [#1].\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the US, Rey connected\n"
"the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes\n"
"sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea\n"
"is so simple.\"\n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted\n"
"constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork,\n"
"therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick\n"
"figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. If\n"
"you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used\n"
"in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the\n"
"book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and\n"
"describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of\n"
"asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, at\n"
"several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since\n"
"Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their\n"
"constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar\n"
"bear scenting prey. This on one hand does not have the usual problem to explain\n"
"its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole\n"
"in this orientation.\n"
"\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns\n"
"in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with\n"
"horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now\n"
"lies in its neck.\n"
"\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the\n"
"serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes\n"
"his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head\n"
"is now one of his feet.\n"
"\n"
" * The Whale (_Cetus_) has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a\n"
"tail fin.\n"
"\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
"\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of\n"
"political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s!)"

"在 19 世紀，帶有華麗雕刻神話人物的插圖豐富的地圖集的使用和進一步版本已經過時了。當時的地圖集中星座的星星開始顯示為與線條圖案（“棒圖”）相關聯，但有時似乎只是用來指示哪些星星屬於哪個星座。\n"
"\n"
"幾十年來，這些人物已經不再像他們以他們命名的人物一樣，並且對於 20 世紀中葉的觀星者來說似乎難以理解。 HA Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977) 是一位德國血統的藝術家和兒童讀物作者，但移民到美國，他於 1952 年出版了他對這個問題的回答，並出版了《星星——一種看待它們的新方法》。參考X1]。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"在這本書中，特別是在美國非常受歡迎，雷伊將每個星座的星星“以這樣一種方式連接起來，從而產生了有意義的形狀”。令他驚訝的是“以前沒有人做過。基本思路就是這麼簡單。”\n"
"\n"
"Rey 的新棒圖讓識別所描繪的星座圖變得非常簡單。 Rey 的作品不包含具象藝術作品，因此這種天空文化特意只帶有 Rey 原創的簡筆劃。星座名稱也總是由雷伊用英文給出。如果您切換到“本地”名稱顯示模式，您可能會看到他書中所使用的拼寫。此外，此處命名的星星僅限於本書中包含的星星。\n"
"\n"
"### 雷伊的數字和經典星座\n"
"\n"
"雷伊的星座堅持西方天空文化的傳統，描述了88個官方承認的星座，並添加了兩個北斗七星和“大廣場”（飛馬座）。然而，在某些點上，雷伊的數字與自托勒密的天啟（公元 2 世紀）以來描述的規範數字有所不同，在那裡，星星在它們的星座中的位置也在它們的名字中描述。例如：\n"
"\n"
" * Rey 將大熊 (Ursa Major) 的形象倒過來，看起來像一隻嗅覺獵物的北極熊。這一方面沒有通常的問題來解釋它的長尾。另一方面，沒有顯示熊在這個方向上繞著桿子走。\n"
"\n"
" * 公牛（金牛座），通常描繪的只有正面長直立的長角，顯示包括尾巴在內的完整身體，角像水牛一樣張開。它明亮的眼睛畢宿五現在躺在它的脖子上。\n"
"\n"
" *赫拉克勒斯的頭部通常緊挨著蛇夫座的頭部，被稱為“基石”的四顆星組成了他的身體。雷伊從拱心石中探出頭來，通常標誌著英雄頭部的星星現在變成了他的一隻腳。\n"
"\n"
" * 鯨魚（Cetus）已經轉過身來，它的前嘴現在形成了一個尾鰭。\n"
"\n"
" * 飛馬座交換了腳和頭。\n"
"\n"
" * 牧民布特斯坐著抽煙斗（1950 年代的一本兒童讀物中沒有任何政治正確的痕跡！）"
