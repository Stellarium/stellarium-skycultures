msgid ""
"During the 19th century the use and further editions of richly illustrated\n"
"atlases with sumptuously engraved mythological figures fell out of fashion. The\n"
"stars of the constellations in atlases of that time started to be shown\n"
"connected with line patterns (\"stickfigures\"), which however appear sometimes\n"
"only to have been used to indicate which stars belong to which constellation.\n"
"\n"
"Over several decades the figures had ceased to resemble the figures they were\n"
"named after and appeared incomprehensible to beginning stargazers in the middle\n"
"of the 20th century. H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977), an artist\n"
"and author of children's books of German descent but emigrated to the USA,\n"
"published his answer to this problem in 1952 with the book _The Stars - A New\n"
"Way To See Them_ [#1].\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the US, Rey connected\n"
"the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes\n"
"sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea\n"
"is so simple.\"\n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted\n"
"constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork,\n"
"therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick\n"
"figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. If\n"
"you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used\n"
"in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the\n"
"book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and\n"
"describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of\n"
"asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, at\n"
"several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since\n"
"Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their\n"
"constellations had been described in their names. For example:\n"
"\n"
" * Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (_Ursa Major_) to look like a polar\n"
"bear scenting prey. This on one hand does not have the usual problem to explain\n"
"its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole\n"
"in this orientation.\n"
"\n"
" * The Bull (_Taurus_), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns\n"
"in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with\n"
"horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye _Aldebaran_ now\n"
"lies in its neck.\n"
"\n"
" * The head of _Hercules_ is usually next to the head of _Ophiuchus_, the\n"
"serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes\n"
"his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head\n"
"is now one of his feet.\n"
"\n"
" * The Whale (_Cetus_) has been turned around, its formermouth now forming a\n"
"tail fin.\n"
"\n"
" * _Pegasus_ exchanged feet and head.\n"
"\n"
" * _Bootes_, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of\n"
"political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s!)"

"在 19 世纪，带有华丽雕刻神话人物的插图丰富的地图集的使用和进一步版本已经过时了。当时的地图集中星座的星星开始显示为与线条图案（“棒图”）相关联，但有时似乎只是用来指示哪些星星属于哪个星座。\n"
"\n"
"几十年来，这些人物已经不再像他们以他们命名的人物一样，并且对于 20 世纪中叶的观星者来说似乎难以理解。 HA Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977) 是一位德国血统的艺术家和儿童读物作者，但移民到美国，他于 1952 年出版了他对这个问题的回答，并出版了《星星——一种看待它们的新方法》。参考X1]。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"在这本书中，特别是在美国非常受欢迎，雷伊将每个星座的星星“以这样一种方式连接起来，从而产生了有意义的形状”。令他惊讶的是“以前没有人做过。基本思路就是这么简单。”\n"
"\n"
"Rey 的新棒图让识别所描绘的星座图变得非常简单。 Rey 的作品不包含具象艺术作品，因此这种天空文化特意只带有 Rey 原创的简笔画。星座名称也总是由雷伊用英文给出。如果您切换到“本地”名称显示模式，您可能会看到他书中所使用的拼写。此外，此处命名的星星仅限于本书中包含的星星。\n"
"\n"
"### 雷伊的数字和经典星座\n"
"\n"
"雷伊的星座坚持西方天空文化的传统，描述了88个官方承认的星座，并添加了两个北斗七星和“大广场”（飞马座）。然而，在某些点上，雷伊的数字与自托勒密的天启（公元 2 世纪）以来描述的规范数字有所不同，在那里，星星在它们的星座中的位置也在它们的名字中描述。例如：\n"
"\n"
" * Rey 将大熊 (Ursa Major) 的形象倒过来，看起来像一只嗅觉猎物的北极熊。这一方面没有通常的问题来解释它的长尾。另一方面，没有显示熊在这个方向上绕着杆子走。\n"
"\n"
" * 公牛（金牛座），通常描绘的只有正面长直立的长角，显示包括尾巴在内的完整身体，角像水牛一样张开。它明亮的眼睛毕宿五现在躺在它的脖子上。\n"
"\n"
" *赫拉克勒斯的头部通常紧挨着蛇夫座的头部，被称为“基石”的四颗星组成了他的身体。雷伊从拱心石中探出头来，通常标志着英雄头部的星星现在变成了他的一只脚。\n"
"\n"
" * 鲸鱼（Cetus）已经转过身来，它的前嘴现在形成了一个尾鳍。\n"
"\n"
" * 飞马座交换了脚和头。\n"
"\n"
" * 牧民布特斯坐着抽烟斗（1950 年代的一本儿童读物中没有任何政治正确的痕迹！）"
