"Sami constellations can be observed on Sami artifacts connected to the old\n"
"religion, suggesting that the night sky played an important cultural role for\n"
"them. The Sami sky culture has a lot in common with other arctic and sub-arctic\n"
"cultures in Eurasia. One unfortunate similarity is that much of the culture was\n"
"lost before it was recorded properly.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a conglomeration of at least three slightly different\n"
"cultures from the people of the South-Sami, North-Sami and Russian Sami. Each\n"
"of these groups have slightly different languages and as such there may be\n"
"small differences with some references [#1][#2].\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark _Bæi'vi mánno\n"
"nástit_ [#3], who based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and\n"
"author Johan Turi.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and Stars\n"
"\n"
"The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing\n"
"during the 19th century. It is unclear if the written record is complete. The\n"
"constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant\n"
"constellation, _Sarva_ — the elk. Sarva is the Sami name for elk, an\n"
"alternative name is _Sarvvis_ — Bull elk. The origin of this constellation\n"
"probably dates back to the old hunter culture before reindeer were\n"
"domesticated.\n"
"\n"
"_Sarva_ consists of the modern constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts of\n"
"Auriga. Constellations and stars surrounding Sarva represent hunters of the\n"
"elk. _Favdna_ (also transcribed as _Favtna_) is the star Arcturus, and\n"
"represents the Hunter who aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (_Fauna\n"
"davgge_ — the Big Dipper). _Favdna_ must aim well, for if he hits\n"
"_Boahjenaste_, the Sky Support (the star Polaris), legend has it that the world\n"
"will come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"_Favdna_ has a number of helpers: _Galla_ (Procyon) and his sons _Gallabarneck_\n"
"(Orion's belt), the \"Ski Runners\", _Cuoigahægjek_ (Castor and Pollux) and \"The\n"
"Runner\" (Vega). The Pleiades are called _Rougot_ (dog pack) or _Miese-cora_\n"
"(calfpack). The identification of Procyon with _Galla_ is not certain: It could\n"
"be Procyon, Rigel, or Sirius - we suggest Procyon as _Galla_ in this sky\n"
"culture because Sirius is very hard to spot from the latitude where the Sami\n"
"live.\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called _Lodde-raiddaras_ (lit. bird path) or _Jakke-mærka_\n"
"(lit. year mark). The name used depends on the season. In the sky chart of\n"
"Johan Turi, one can observe a star _Guovso-naste_, morning star, that can be\n"
"identified as Venus, but this is not certain as it can also be identified as\n"
"Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in the\n"
"Norse sky culture).\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture does not have a large number of constellations. This is\n"
"thought to be mainly because of the high Northerly latitude of the Sami\n"
"people's range. Two factors contribute to this: that the Southern sky stays\n"
"below the horizon to a large extent, and that the Aurora Borealis is frequently\n"
"bright enough to obscure many stars."
