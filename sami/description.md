# Sami

## Introduction

The Sami people are considered to be the native population of northern Norway,
Sweden, Finland and West Russia (the Kola Peninsula).

## Description

Sami constellations can be observed on Sami artifacts connected to the old
religion, suggesting that the night sky played an important cultural role for
them. The Sami sky culture has a lot in common with other arctic and sub-arctic
cultures in Eurasia. One unfortunate similarity is that much of the culture was
lost before it was recorded properly.

This sky culture is a conglomeration of at least three slightly different
cultures from the people of the South-Sami, North-Sami and Russian Sami. Each
of these groups have slightly different languages and as such there may be
small differences with some references [#1][#2].

Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark _Bæi'vi mánno
nástit_ [#3], who based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and
author Johan Turi.

### Constellations and Stars

The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing
during the 19th century. It is unclear if the written record is complete. The
constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant
constellation, _Sarva_ — the elk. Sarva is the Sami name for elk, an
alternative name is _Sarvvis_ — Bull elk. The origin of this constellation
probably dates back to the old hunter culture before reindeer were
domesticated.

_Sarva_ consists of the modern constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts of
Auriga. Constellations and stars surrounding Sarva represent hunters of the
elk. _Favdna_ (also transcribed as _Favtna_) is the star Arcturus, and
represents the Hunter who aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (_Fauna
davgge_ — the Big Dipper). _Favdna_ must aim well, for if he hits
_Boahjenaste_, the Sky Support (the star Polaris), legend has it that the world
will come to an end.

_Favdna_ has a number of helpers: _Galla_ (Procyon) and his sons _Gallabarneck_
(Orion's belt), the "Ski Runners", _Cuoigahægjek_ (Castor and Pollux) and "The
Runner" (Vega). The Pleiades are called _Rougot_ (dog pack) or _Miese-cora_
(calfpack). The identification of Procyon with _Galla_ is not certain: It could
be Procyon, Rigel, or Sirius - we suggest Procyon as _Galla_ in this sky
culture because Sirius is very hard to spot from the latitude where the Sami
live.

The Milky Way is called _Lodde-raiddaras_ (lit. bird path) or _Jakke-mærka_
(lit. year mark). The name used depends on the season. In the sky chart of
Johan Turi, one can observe a star _Guovso-naste_, morning star, that can be
identified as Venus, but this is not certain as it can also be identified as
Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in the
Norse sky culture).

The Sami sky culture does not have a large number of constellations. This is
thought to be mainly because of the high Northerly latitude of the Sami
people's range. Two factors contribute to this: that the Southern sky stays
below the horizon to a large extent, and that the Aurora Borealis is frequently
bright enough to obscure many stars.
