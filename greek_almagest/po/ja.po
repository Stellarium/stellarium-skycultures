"<p>This ancient Greek sky culture is compiled in a book that is today known "
"by its Arabic title \"Almagest\".\n"
"This book was written in Roman time (under the reign of Roman emperor "
"Hadrian) at Alexandria (Africa) in\n"
"Greek language, with dates given in Egyptian month names and years counted "
"after a Babylonian king,\n"
"so it is clearly a multi-cultural compendium of knowledge. It is a "
"compilation of\n"
"astronomical knowledge of former astronomers including results from\n"
"observations and mathematical astronomy. Pieced together by Claudius\n"
"Ptolemy, using older, as well as his own, observations, it was written\n"
"in Greek, published in the Second Century and remained the main\n"
"astronomical work for the following 1500 years. It was originally written\n"
"with the title <i>Mathematike Syntaxis</i>, in Ancient Greek.\n"
"The name <i>Almagest</i>, meaning &ldquo;The Largest [Book]&rdquo;, was\n"
"developed from Arabian translations. To create this sky culture we used\n"
"the English translation by Toomer (1984), reworked it in some details\n"
"(e.g. using more literal translations from Greek instead of Latin terms "
"that\n"
"are common today) and we made use of computer readable tables prepared\n"
"by Ernie Wright.</p>\n"
"<p>The Almagest consists of 13 sections, called books. In the seventh\n"
"and eighth book, Ptolemy listed a total of 1022 stars in 48 constellations\n"
"(among which are about 5 star-like objects like globular star clusters).\n"
"It is a table of coordinates of the stars with a description of their\n"
"position in the constellation (such as \"star at the elbow of X, longitude,\n"
"latitude, magnitude\"). With regard to precession, Ptolemy used ecliptic\n"
"coordinates. As one of the first of his time, Ptolemy included the\n"
"magnitude, a quantitative scale of stellar brightness, probably adopted\n"
"from Hipparchus (which is not certain because Hipparchus&rsquo; catalog\n"
"is not preserved). The scale starts with the brightest star with the\n"
"magnitude of 1, going down to magnitude of 6, for the faintest stars\n"
"visible.</p>\n"
"<p>For the computation of planet positions Ptolemy used a geocentric model\n"
"(which is allowed because the observer always stands on Earth) and, thus,\n"
"contributed to the scientific belief that the heliocentric model by\n"
"Aristarch was not needed. However, for the star catalogue of the\n"
"<i>Almagest</i> this does not matter at all because a star catalogue\n"
"always represents a sort of inventory of the fixed dots in the sky and\n"
"Ptolemy's proclaimed aim of the catalogue is to provide a list for making\n"
"a celestial globe (see Alm., VIII, 3). Being aware of precession he wants\n"
"to ease the business of future globemakers by using ecliptical coordinates:\n"
"Precession as known to Ptolemy shifts all stars parallel to the ecliptic,\n"
"therefore updates to the epoch of the respective globemaker could be\n"
"applied by a simple subtraction of the value for ecliptic longitude.</p>"

"### How this sky culture was made\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"Out of more than 1,000 stars, Ptolemy mentions a proper name for only 15.\n"
"The rest are identified by fairly long descriptions such as \"The star on\n"
"the end of the tail\" for the Polaris. In order to avoid displaying such "
"long\n"
"strings across the screen in Stellarium, we invented short labels for all\n"
"Almagest stars based on the constellation and the order in which they appear "
"in\n"
"the catalogue.  For example, Polaris is given a designation \"UMi 1\" "
"because\n"
"it is the first star in the constellation of Small Bear (UMi).  See the "
"table\n"
"below for the correspondence between Ptolemy constellations and IAU "
"abbreviations.\n"
"In addition, where Ptolemy describes a star as lying outside of the figure,\n"
"we use lowercase letters in the corresponding label. To see the long "
"description\n"
"for a given star, users should enable \"Use additional names of stars\" in "
"the\n"
"\"View [F4]/Sky\" settings and click on the star. The long description will "
"then\n"
"be displayed at the top of the screen.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellation lines\n"
"\n"
"<p>The process can be described as sketched here with the example of\n"
"Corvus:</p>\n"
"<p>In the constellation of Corvus (Raven), &alpha; Crv is the star in\n"
"the &quot;head of the raven&quot;. It is connected with the &quot;star\n"
"in the neck&quot;, &epsilon; Crv.  This one is connected with &quot;the\n"
"star in the breast&quot; &zeta; Crv.  From there two lines go to the\n"
"tips of the wings. &gamma; Crv is the star in the advanced wing and\n"
"&delta; Crv the star in the rear wing. From the star in the breast\n"
"another line goes to the &quot;foot of the raven&quot;, the star &beta;\n"
"Crv.</p>\n"
"<p><img width=\"800\" src=\"corvus_s.png\" /></p>\n"
"<p>After identifying the stars based on their coordinates and names, we\n"
"reconnected the stars according to the descriptions in the table\n"
"presented in the <i>Almagest</i>.</p>\n"
"<p>The names of stars and names of deep sky objects rely on the Almagest\n"
"only, e.g. Ptolemy uses the name &quot;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&alpha;&delta;"
"&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;\n"

"Out of more than 1,000 stars, Ptolemy mentions a proper name for only 15.\n"
"The rest are identified by fairly long descriptions such as \"The star on "
"the\n"
"end of the tail\" for the Polaris. In order to avoid displaying such long\n"
"strings across the screen in Stellarium, we invented short labels for all\n"
"Almagest stars based on the constellation and the order in which they "
"appear\n"
"in the catalogue.  For example, Polaris is given a designation \"UMi 1\"\n"
"because it is the first star in the constellation of Small Bear (UMi).  See\n"
"the table below for the correspondence between Ptolemy constellations and\n"
"IAU abbreviations.  In addition, where Ptolemy describes a star as lying\n"
"outside of the figure, we use lowercase letters in the corresponding\n"
"label. To see the long description for a given star, users should enable\n"
"\"Use additional names of stars\" in the \"View [F4]/Sky\" settings and "
"click on\n"
"the star. The long description will then be displayed at the top of the\n"
