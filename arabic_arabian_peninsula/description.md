# Arabic (Arabian Peninsula)

## Introduction

The Arabic (Arabian Peninsula) sky culture reflects the oral folk tradition of star names and asterisms in the Arabian Peninsula, primarily found scattered in poetry and proverbs.

## Description

The Arabian Peninsula is a region covering the southwestern corner of Asia, bordered by the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian/Persian Gulf to the east, and the Red Sea to the west. The northern border is not precisely defined, but according to ancient geographers, it is bordered by rivers, notably the Euphrates River [#16] [#17]. This region is inhabited by Arabs and includes Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and parts of Syria and Iraq.

Bedouins and farmers across the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on stars to time their nomadic journeys, care for animals, forecast weather, and conduct agricultural activities. Stars are frequently mentioned in their proverbs and poetry. Fortunately, oral poetry and proverbs have been documented and preserved by various scholars. Surveying the collections of these scholars alongside oral traditions reveals the star knowledge of the people in this region.

The stars used for timing are the same as those of ancient Arabs, but the system is simplified by beginning the year with the heliacal rising of al-Thurayyā, the Pleiades, at the start of summer, then counting 13 days for each lunar station, except al-Ǧabhah, which has 14 days. This results in a 27 lunar stations × 13 days + 14 days (al-Ǧabhah) = 365-day cycle. Other timing methods were also used, such as the monthly Pleiades-Moon conjunction or using stars like those of the Big Dipper.

The sources indicate that star names and asterisms are fewer compared to those of ancient Arabs. Only the brightest stars and prominent asterisms were named and used. An important source of continuing star knowledge is the poetry of al-Ḫalāwī, a poet whose era is uncertain but estimated to be in the 17th century [#3]. Another key source is a poem by Moḥammad al-Qāḍī (~1809–1886), in which he described all 28 lunar stations, citing their local names [#2].

## Constellations

##### The Two Guards

The Two Guards are the stars β Ursae Minoris and γ Ursae Minoris, traditionally used in desert navigation.

Seeking protection from their wrath, al-Jady turned to these two nearby stars, which became known as the “Two Guards.” [#1].
