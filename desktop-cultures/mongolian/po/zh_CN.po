"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
" Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is "
"symbolized by the golden stick (*Altan Hadaas*). Almost all Mongolian "
"asterisms are similar to those that we know. However some have other names "
"like *Num Sum* (The Bow and the Arrow) for the constellation Swan, or "
"*Doloon Burkhan* for the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The summer triangle "
"made up of Vega, Deneb and Altair stars refers to three stags (*Gurvan Maral "
"Od* in Mongolian). And Cassiopeia represents, in the Mongolian imagination, "
"the Five Stars Woman (*Hun Tavan Od*).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
" Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculates the positions of each of "
"the planets visible with the naked eye. Because planets beyond Saturn are "
"not visible without telescope (the instrument which appeared long time after "
"the creation of their astrology), the Mongolians have attributed one of the "
"five planets for each day of the week, completing with the Sun (*Nar*) for "
"Sunday and the Moon (*Sar*) for Monday. The names of the Solar System's "
"planets and Pluto have some peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named "
"*Bud* (associated with Wednesday), Venus, *Sugar* (associated with Friday), "
"the Earth, *Delkhii*, Mars, *Angarag* (associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, "
"*Barhasbadi* (associated with Thursday), Saturn, *Sanchir* (associated with "
"Saturday), Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, Neptune, *Dalai-van* and at last Pluto, "
"*Dalkhii-van*. We can see that the three last, invisible to the naked eye "
"and discovered long time after the others, have the characteristic to have "
"the particle *-van* at the end of the name, indicating the princely status "
"in Mongolian. Earth and Pluto are named similarly, except that this last one "
"has this particle. It is possible to translate from Mongolian Pluto like "
"\"The princely ground\" (ground and not Earth because it means here the "
"surface on which we walk, not the Earth. Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, could be "
"translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptune, *Dalai-van*, as the \"princely "
"ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real equivalent in English, and "
"translations above are presented to give an idea of the planets name's "
"meaning. However, the names of the celestial bodies specified here come from "
"Sanskrit (language spoken in India) and are largely used in the current "
"language in Mongolia but in an unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
" It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating "
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: indeed, *Tengeriin Zadas* appoints "
"the Milky Way. We could literally translate this as the \"Sky Line"
"\" (*Tengeriin* for the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and "
"*Zadas* for the line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the "
"star located above Mizar in the Big Bear. It symbolises the recover and "
"protection star. It was placed here by *Tengeriin* (god of heaven) to "
"protect Mizar. To become an archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it "
"seemed that one had to be able to discern these two stars with the naked "
"eye.\n"
"\n"
" From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes "
"back to *Ulug Beg* (AD1394-1449; *Taraghay* by his real name), astronomer, "
"mathematician and viceroy in Samarkand whose empire spread as far as Central "
"Asia. Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies "
"and astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely "
"precisely measure Saturn's revolution period (*Sanchir*) with a sextant of "
"40 meters radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
" Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation "
"is limited for them to the seven Dipper stars making the bear's tail and "
"body, but the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding "
"capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it "
"peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked "
"the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to "
"rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went "
"together to assist their queen. They searched the monster during two days "
"and three nights, when in the middle of the third night, they found and "
"killed the monster. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to threw it "
"in the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The younger brother "
"succeeded the test and changed immediately into the North Star (Polar Star). "
"The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting "
"their younger brother every night. The name *Doloon burkhan* (the Seven "
"Buddhas) come from this legend to appoint the Great Bear and the Golden "
"Stick, *Altan Hadaas*, the Polar Star.\n"
"\n"
" A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian "
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to "
"each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. "
"Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian "
"calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself "
"associated to a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, "
"corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the ox and "
"so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the "
"year of the horse. Then we come back to the first, the sheep year and we "
"repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese "
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the "
"tail are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"[Note by G. Zotti: This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described "
"by *Elverskog*. There however, the association of the stars goes in an up-"
"and-down movement, i.e., Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox, ... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, "
"Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.]\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"550\">\n"
"\n"
"### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
" Shooting stars have also a specific meaning: they are personified through "
"their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they imagine that it is a "
"star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes somebody who just died. "
"Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say: \"Phew, it is not me!"
"\"\n"
"\n"
"### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
" Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and *Hun "
"Tavan Od* (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost "
"forgotten by most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"#### Sun\n"
"\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly "
"dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very "
"good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns "
"without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself "
"all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot "
"(groundhog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, "
"pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth "
"which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards "
"the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The "
"bird was hit. The man had not reach his goal, so he left towards exile in a "
"hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved "
"our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's "
"surface.\n"
"\n"
" We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the "
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist "
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"#### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
"> At that time lived a scary monster named *Raah* which frightened the "
"entire world. He devoured all who were in its way. The god *Orchiwaani* "
"owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, *Raah* "
"stole the spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the "
"act and reported to *Orchiwaani*. Seething with rage to hear about this "
"piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but "
"it grew again immediately because *Raah* had become immortal. He thought "
"then to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again "
"directly. Just as *Orchiwaani* would seize the monster to finish it off, it "
"escaped and disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then *Orchiwaani* "
"asked the Moon, who recaptured *Raah* and cut its rump and its tail. In "
"revenge, the monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun which "
"exit immediately, giving rise to moon and solar eclipses.\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that *Raah* devours "
"the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise so that the monster "
"liberates the eclipsed star. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck "
"wrote:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Some [Mongolian people] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them [to "
"other Mongolian people] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about "
"to produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the "
"door of their habitation. And while the eclipse happened, they play the drum "
"and instruments and do big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, "
"they devote themselves to beverage and festivity and do big party.\"\n"
"\n"
"(Source: [#1])\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their "
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for "
"the tourists. Also note the similarity of *Raah* with Indian *Rahu*.\n"
"\n"
"#### Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for "
"the Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five "
"children of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. "
"Their mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to "
"untie a knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united "
"with other, and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. "
"Conversely, if the knots withstood the test, the five brothers would remain "
"united and close for the rest of their lives and would be victorious at the "
"time of wars.\n"
"\n"
"### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one "
"hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
" Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (*Doloon Burkhan*) by throwing "
"milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. "
"They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not "
"for just one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced "
"by vodka which, even if it is colorless, symbolizes the dark color and the "
"strength for Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear "
"and fends off evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
" The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian "
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs "
"which are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission "
"is essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. "
"It is therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high "
"fidelity and precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, "
"every observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"一般来说，恒星是围绕着以金标桩 (*Altan Hadaas*)为代表的北极恒星旋转的动物。几"
"乎所有的蒙古星座都与我们所知道的相似。 然而，有一些还有其他名字，比如天鹅座的"
"是*Num Sum*（弓和箭），或者北斗七星*Doloon Burkhan* （七佛）。由织女一，河鼓"
"二，天津四组成的夏季大三角指的是三雄鹿（蒙古语中的*Gurvan Maral Od*）。 在蒙"
"古人的想象中，仙后座代表了五星之母（*Hun Tavan Od* ）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星和恒星\n"
"\n"
" 最初，藏蒙占星术用肉眼计算出每个行星的位置。因为没有望远镜（仪器在占星术创建"
"后出现很长时间）就不能看到土星以外的行星，蒙古人将五大行星对应星期二到星期流"
"六加上星期天的太阳（ *Nar*）和星期一的和月亮（*Sar*）。太阳系的行星和冥王星的"
"名字在蒙古语中有一些特点。水星被命名为*Bud*（与星期三相关），金星-*Sugar*（与"
"星期五相关），地球- *Delkhii*，火星- *Angarag* （与周二相关），木星-"
"*Barhasbadi*（与周四相关），土星- *Sanchir*（与星期六相关），天王星-"
"*Tengeriin-van*，海王星-*Dalai-van*，最后是冥王星-*Dalkhii-van*。最后三个行星"
"肉眼看不见，并在其它行星发现之后很长时间才发现，具有在名称末尾有后缀 *-van* "
"的特征，表示蒙古族的王族。地球和冥王星的命名相似，只不过冥王星有这个后缀。当"
"地的天体名称主要来自梵语（在印度使用的语言）。\n"
"\n"
"蒙古的天文描述与其信仰之间的紧密联系也非常有趣：事实上，*Tengeriin Zadas*意思"
"是银河系。我们可以把它翻译为“天空线”（ *Tengeriin*为天空，这也意味着天空之"
"神，*Zadas*为线）。众所周知的蒙古恒星传说是关于辅星的，这颗星位于开阳星上方。"
"它是象征恢复和守护的恒星。为了守护开阳星，它被*Tengeriin*（天堂之神）放置在这"
"里。要成为成吉思汗（13世纪）的弓箭手，似乎必须能够用肉眼辨别出这两颗恒星。\n"
"\n"
" 从历史的角度来看，这种天空的认识可以追溯到*兀鲁伯*（1394-1449; *，帖木尔之"
"孙，真名穆罕默德·塔拉盖*），天文学家，数学家和撒马尔罕的总督。他背弃了他的王"
"室义务，研究了他那个时代的天体和天文问题。他是第一个用半径40米的六分仪非常准"
"确地测量土星的（*Sanchir*）的人。\n"
"\n"
"### 神话\n"
"\n"
"### 北斗\n"
"\n"
" 蒙古人特别喜欢北斗七星，有关它的传说可能是蒙古最着名的。\n"
"\n"
"> 曾经，有八个孤儿兄弟拥有出色的能力，生活在一个王国里。国王和王后和平地生活"
"在其中。有一天，一个怪物来了并绑架了女王。国王让八兄弟把她带回来说：“如果你们"
"其中一人成功拯救了我心爱的人，我会给他一个金色的箭头”。孤儿们一起去帮助他们的"
"女王。他们在两天三夜中搜寻了怪物，当时在第三天中旬，他们发现并杀死了怪物。他"
"们把女王带回了城堡。\n"
">\n"
"> 国王没有将箭头分成八部分，他决定把它扔在天空中。第一个抓住它可以保留它。弟"
"弟接受了测试并立即成为北极星。其他七个人变成了七个佛，七个佛每晚都会拜访他们"
"的弟弟。星座 *Doloon burkhan* （七佛）和 *Altan Hadaas*（金标桩）来自这个传"
"说。\n"
"\n"
"一个特别有意思的传统是蒙古人和北斗七星之间的联系，因为他们被授予了七星中的一"
"个。 这种联系取决于中国历法中的出生年份。中国和蒙古的历法有相似之处（蒙古历基"
"于农历）。 每年都有一只动物的象征，它本身与星座中的一颗星相关联。第一个，天枢"
"是鼠年，第二个，天璇，是牛年，一直到北斗七星尾巴的末端，摇光是马年。 然后我们"
"回到天枢，羊年，重复一次，直到中国历法的猪年。结果，星座尾部的两颗恒星只被分"
"配一次。\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Doloon "
"Burkhana\">\n"
"\n"
"### 流星\n"
"\n"
"流星也有特殊的含义：它们是通过他们的信仰来人格化的。当他们看到这些流星时，他"
"们会想象它是一颗从天而降的星星，象征着刚刚死去的人。 虽然西方人许愿，蒙古人"
"说：“哎呀，不是我！”\n"
"\n"
"### 被忽略的传说\n"
"\n"
"三个传说同样丰富的意义，涉及太阳，日月食和 *Hun Tavan Od* （五星之母）。然"
"而，现在它们被大多数蒙古人忽视并几乎被遗忘：\n"
"\n"
"#### 太阳\n"
"\n"
"> 在世界创始不久，大地被七个太阳所炙烤。有一个非常优秀的弓箭手，向众神承诺，"
"他会射掉所有的太阳。如果他失败了，他会一个接一个地切断自己的所有手指，变成土"
"拨鼠留在洞中，以抵御对他构成压力的诅咒。他拿起弓，拉了第一支箭，击中了他的目"
"标。第二，第三，直到第六，摧毁了太阳。他完成了将第七支箭拉向最后的太阳，一只"
"燕子刚好飞过，拦截了射出的箭。男人没有达到他的目标，所以他走向一个洞，流下手"
"指，变成了土拨鼠。燕子刚刚救了我们的太阳，否则一切生命都会从世界的表面消"
"失。\n"
"\n"
"#### 日月食\n"
"\n"
"> 一种叫做*Raah*的可怕怪物，吓到了整个世界。他吞噬了所有阻碍他的人。神"
"*Orchiwaani*有一种神奇的酒。喝了它的人会永生。有一天，*Raah*偷走了酒并喝了"
"它。月亮和太阳抓住了怪物并向 *Orchiwaani*报告。他非常生气地听了消息，去和怪物"
"作战。他几次切断了怪物的头，但因为*Raah*变成永生而自动长出来。他最后切断了怪"
"物的臀部和尾巴。为了复仇，怪物有时会回来吃月亮或太阳，这就是月食和日食。\n"
"\n"
"当有日食或者月食时，蒙古人知道这意味着*Raah*吞噬月亮或太阳，他们会发出很多噪"
"音，以便怪物释放出太阳和月亮。在13世纪，Guillaume de Rubruck写道：\n"
"\n"
"> \"一些[蒙古人]对天文学有所了解，并（对其他蒙古人）预测月食和日食。日食发生"
"时，他们演奏鼓和乐器，做大声吵闹。日食结束后，他们在喝酒放纵，并举办大型聚"
"会。\"\n"
"\n"
"(来源: [#1])\n"
" <p>2008年的日食旅行者仍然目睹了司机和厨师躲在帐篷里并用锅子制造噪音。这似乎"
"是真实的，而不是游客的表演。 还要注意<em> Raah </ em>与印度的 *Rahu*的相似之"
"处。</p>\n"
"\n"
"#### 五星之母\n"
"\n"
"*Hun Tavan Od*（五星之母），也就是仙后座的五颗亮星，象征着蒙古人的团结，兄弟"
"情谊和团结。星座的五颗星代表成吉思汗的妻子Oulin的五个孩子。\n"
"\n"
"### 与天空相关的其他信仰\n"
"\n"
"根据蒙古传说，有一个致力于在天空中数清楚一百颗星星的女人梦想着她未来的丈"
"夫。\n"
"\n"
"有时，蒙古人通过向其方向倒牛奶来纪念七佛（*Doloon Burkhan*） 。白色牛奶象征着"
"蒙古的纯洁。他们祈祷，以便可以实现某些事情，但对于一些人而言，这会带来厄运。"
"牛奶可以用伏特加代替，伏特加虽然是无色的，但却象征着蒙古人的黑色。 通过这样"
"做，它可以避免不幸，争吵，恐惧，并防止邪恶的心理。\n"
"\n"
"### 结论\n"
"\n"
"这些星座的确受到了西方人的启发，在这里简要介绍的蒙古宇宙观强调了与之相关的信"
"仰的显着特征。 蒙古文化和知识传播本质上是口头的，关于这些主题的书面记录很少。"
"因此，特别难以将其宇宙观与高保真度和高精度联系起来。 为了保留关于这个宇宙观的"
"知识，欢迎任何评论，建议或合作！\n"
