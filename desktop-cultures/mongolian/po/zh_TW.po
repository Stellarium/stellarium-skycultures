"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental "

"one's bearing even during the night and at different seasons, by searching "
"the weather's mildness, is probably one of the element which developed their "

"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
" Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is "
"symbolized by the golden stick (*Altan Hadaas*). Almost all Mongolian "
"asterisms are similar to those that we know. However some have other names "
"like *Num Sum* (The Bow and the Arrow) for the constellation Swan, or "
"*Doloon Burkhan* for the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The summer triangle "
"made up of Vega, Deneb and Altair stars refers to three stags (*Gurvan Maral "
"Od* in Mongolian). And Cassiopeia represents, in the Mongolian imagination, "
"the Five Stars Woman (*Hun Tavan Od*).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
" Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculates the positions of each of "
"the planets visible with the naked eye. Because planets beyond Saturn are "
"not visible without telescope (the instrument which appeared long time after "
"the creation of their astrology), the Mongolians have attributed one of the "
"five planets for each day of the week, completing with the Sun (*Nar*) for "
"Sunday and the Moon (*Sar*) for Monday. The names of the Solar System's "
"planets and Pluto have some peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named "
"*Bud* (associated with Wednesday), Venus, *Sugar* (associated with Friday), "
"the Earth, *Delkhii*, Mars, *Angarag* (associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, "
"*Barhasbadi* (associated with Thursday), Saturn, *Sanchir* (associated with "
"Saturday), Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, Neptune, *Dalai-van* and at last Pluto, "
"*Dalkhii-van*. We can see that the three last, invisible to the naked eye "
"and discovered long time after the others, have the characteristic to have "
"the particle *-van* at the end of the name, indicating the princely status "
"in Mongolian. Earth and Pluto are named similarly, except that this last one "
"has this particle. It is possible to translate from Mongolian Pluto like "
"\"The princely ground\" (ground and not Earth because it means here the "
"surface on which we walk, not the Earth. Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, could be "
"translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptune, *Dalai-van*, as the \"princely "
"ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real equivalent in English, and "
"translations above are presented to give an idea of the planets name's "
"meaning. However, the names of the celestial bodies specified here come from "
"Sanskrit (language spoken in India) and are largely used in the current "
"language in Mongolia but in an unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
" It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating "
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: indeed, *Tengeriin Zadas* appoints "
"the Milky Way. We could literally translate this as the \"Sky Line"
"\" (*Tengeriin* for the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and "
"*Zadas* for the line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the "
"star located above Mizar in the Big Bear. It symbolises the recover and "
"protection star. It was placed here by *Tengeriin* (god of heaven) to "
"protect Mizar. To become an archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it "
"seemed that one had to be able to discern these two stars with the naked "
"eye.\n"
"\n"
" From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes "
"back to *Ulug Beg* (AD1394-1449; *Taraghay* by his real name), astronomer, "
"mathematician and viceroy in Samarkand whose empire spread as far as Central "
"Asia. Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies "
"and astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely "
"precisely measure Saturn's revolution period (*Sanchir*) with a sextant of "
"40 meters radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
" Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation "
"is limited for them to the seven Dipper stars making the bear's tail and "
"body, but the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding "
"capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it "
"peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked "
"the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to "
"rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went "
"together to assist their queen. They searched the monster during two days "
"and three nights, when in the middle of the third night, they found and "
"killed the monster. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to threw it "
"in the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The younger brother "
"succeeded the test and changed immediately into the North Star (Polar Star). "
"The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting "
"their younger brother every night. The name *Doloon burkhan* (the Seven "
"Buddhas) come from this legend to appoint the Great Bear and the Golden "
"Stick, *Altan Hadaas*, the Polar Star.\n"
"\n"
" A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian "
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to "
"each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. "
"Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian "
"calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself "
"associated to a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, "
"corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the ox and "
"so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the "
"year of the horse. Then we come back to the first, the sheep year and we "
"repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese "
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the "
"tail are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"[Note by G. Zotti: This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described "
"by *Elverskog*. There however, the association of the stars goes in an up-"
"and-down movement, i.e., Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox, ... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, "
"Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.]\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"550\">\n"
"\n"
"### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
" Shooting stars have also a specific meaning: they are personified through "
"their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they imagine that it is a "
"star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes somebody who just died. "
"Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say: \"Phew, it is not me!"
"\"\n"
"\n"
"### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
" Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and *Hun "
"Tavan Od* (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost "
"forgotten by most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"#### Sun\n"
"\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly "
"dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very "
"good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns "
"without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself "
"all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot "
"(groundhog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, "
"pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth "
"which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards "
"the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The "
"bird was hit. The man had not reach his goal, so he left towards exile in a "
"hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved "
"our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's "
"surface.\n"
"\n"
" We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the "
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist "
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"#### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
"> At that time lived a scary monster named *Raah* which frightened the "
"entire world. He devoured all who were in its way. The god *Orchiwaani* "
"owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, *Raah* "
"stole the spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the "
"act and reported to *Orchiwaani*. Seething with rage to hear about this "
"piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but "
"it grew again immediately because *Raah* had become immortal. He thought "
"then to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again "
"directly. Just as *Orchiwaani* would seize the monster to finish it off, it "
"escaped and disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then *Orchiwaani* "
"asked the Moon, who recaptured *Raah* and cut its rump and its tail. In "
"revenge, the monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun which "
"exit immediately, giving rise to moon and solar eclipses.\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that *Raah* devours "
"the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise so that the monster "
"liberates the eclipsed star. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck "
"wrote:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Some [Mongolian people] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them [to "
"other Mongolian people] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about "
"to produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the "
"door of their habitation. And while the eclipse happened, they play the drum "
"and instruments and do big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, "
"they devote themselves to beverage and festivity and do big party.\"\n"
"\n"
"(Source: [#1])\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their "
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for "
"the tourists. Also note the similarity of *Raah* with Indian *Rahu*.\n"
"\n"
"#### Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for "
"the Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five "
"children of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. "
"Their mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to "
"untie a knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united "
"with other, and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. "
"Conversely, if the knots withstood the test, the five brothers would remain "
"united and close for the rest of their lives and would be victorious at the "
"time of wars.\n"
"\n"
"### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one "
"hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
" Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (*Doloon Burkhan*) by throwing "
"milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. "
"They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not "
"for just one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced "
"by vodka which, even if it is colorless, symbolizes the dark color and the "
"strength for Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear "
"and fends off evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
" The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian "
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs "
"which are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission "
"is essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. "
"It is therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high "
"fidelity and precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, "
"every observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"一般來說，恒星是圍繞著以金標樁 (*Altan Hadaas*)為代表的北極恒星旋轉的動物。幾"
"乎所有的蒙古星座都與我們所知道的相似。 然而，有一些還有其他名字，比如天鵝座的"
"是*Num Sum*（弓和箭），或者北斗七星*Doloon Burkhan* （七佛）。由織女一，河鼓"
"二，天津四組成的夏季大三角指的是三雄鹿（蒙古語中的*Gurvan Maral Od*）。 在蒙"
"古人的想像中，仙后座代表了五星之母（*Hun Tavan Od* ）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星和恒星\n"
"\n"
" 最初，藏蒙占星術用肉眼計算出每個行星的位置。因為沒有望遠鏡（儀器在占星術創建"
"後出現很長時間）就不能看到土星以外的行星，蒙古人將五大行星對應星期二到星期流"
"六加上星期天的太陽（ *Nar*）和星期一的和月亮（*Sar*）。太陽系的行星和冥王星的"
"名字在蒙古語中有一些特點。水星被命名為*Bud*（與星期三相關），金星-*Sugar*（與"
"星期五相關），地球- *Delkhii*，火星- *Angarag* （與週二相關），木星-"
"*Barhasbadi*（與週四相關），土星- *Sanchir*（與星期六相關），天王星-"
"*Tengeriin-van*，海王星-*Dalai-van*，最後是冥王星-*Dalkhii-van*。最後三個行星"
"肉眼看不見，並在其它行星發現之後很長時間才發現，具有在名稱末尾有尾碼 *-van* "
"的特徵，表示蒙古族的王族。地球和冥王星的命名相似，只不過冥王星有這個尾碼。當"
"地的天體名稱主要來自梵語（在印度使用的語言）。\n"
"\n"
"蒙古的天文描述與其信仰之間的緊密聯繫也非常有趣：事實上，*Tengeriin Zadas*意思"
"是銀河系。我們可以把它翻譯為“天空線”（ *Tengeriin*為天空，這也意味著天空之"
"神，*Zadas*為線）。眾所周知的蒙古恒星傳說是關於輔星的，這顆星位於開陽星上方。"
"它是象徵恢復和守護的恒星。為了守護開陽星，它被*Tengeriin*（天堂之神）放置在這"
"裡。要成為成吉思汗（13世紀）的弓箭手，似乎必須能夠用肉眼辨別出這兩顆恒星。\n"
"\n"
" 從歷史的角度來看，這種天空的認識可以追溯到*兀魯伯*（1394-1449; *，帖木爾之"
"孫，真名穆罕默德·塔拉蓋*），天文學家，數學家和撒馬爾罕的總督。他背棄了他的王"
"室義務，研究了他那個時代的天體和天文問題。他是第一個用半徑40米的六分儀非常準"
"確地測量土星的（*Sanchir*）的人。\n"
"\n"
"### 神話\n"
"\n"
"### 北斗\n"
"\n"
" 蒙古人特別喜歡北斗七星，有關它的傳說可能是蒙古最著名的。\n"
"\n"
"> 曾經，有八個孤兒兄弟擁有出色的能力，生活在一個王國裡。國王和王后和平地生活"
"在其中。有一天，一個怪物來了並綁架了女王。國王讓八兄弟把她帶回來說：“如果你們"
"其中一人成功拯救了我心愛的人，我會給他一個金色的箭頭”。孤兒們一起去幫助他們的"
"女王。他們在兩天三夜中搜尋了怪物，當時在第三天中旬，他們發現並殺死了怪物。他"
"們把女王帶回了城堡。\n"
">\n"
"> 國王沒有將箭頭分成八部分，他決定把它扔在天空中。第一個抓住它可以保留它。弟"
"弟接受了測試並立即成為北極星。其他七個人變成了七個佛，七個佛每晚都會拜訪他們"
"的弟弟。星座 *Doloon burkhan* （七佛）和 *Altan Hadaas*（金標樁）來自這個傳"
"說。\n"
"\n"
"一個特別有意思的傳統是蒙古人和北斗七星之間的聯繫，因為他們被授予了七星中的一"
"個。 這種聯繫取決於中國曆法中的出生年份。中國和蒙古的曆法有相似之處（蒙古曆基"
"於農曆）。 每年都有一隻動物的象徵，它本身與星座中的一顆星相關聯。第一個，天樞"
"是鼠年，第二個，天璿，是牛年，一直到北斗七星尾巴的末端，搖光是馬年。 然後我們"
"回到天樞，羊年，重複一次，直到中國曆法的豬年。結果，星座尾部的兩顆恒星只被分"
"配一次。\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Doloon "
"Burkhana\">\n"
"\n"
"### 流星\n"
"\n"
"流星也有特殊的含義：它們是通過他們的信仰來人格化的。當他們看到這些流星時，他"
"們會想像它是一顆從天而降的星星，象徵著剛剛死去的人。 雖然西方人許願，蒙古人"
"說：“哎呀，不是我！”\n"
"\n"
"### 被忽略的傳說\n"
"\n"
"三個傳說同樣豐富的意義，涉及太陽，日月食和 *Hun Tavan Od* （五星之母）。然"
"而，現在它們被大多數蒙古人忽視並幾乎被遺忘：\n"
"\n"
"#### 太陽\n"
"\n"
"> 在世界創始不久，大地被七個太陽所炙烤。有一個非常優秀的弓箭手，向眾神承諾，"
"他會射掉所有的太陽。如果他失敗了，他會一個接一個地切斷自己的所有手指，變成土"
"撥鼠留在洞中，以抵禦對他構成壓力的詛咒。他拿起弓，拉了第一支箭，擊中了他的目"
"標。第二，第三，直到第六，摧毀了太陽。他完成了將第七支箭拉向最後的太陽，一隻"
"燕子剛好飛過，攔截了射出的箭。男人沒有達到他的目標，所以他走向一個洞，流下手"
"指，變成了土撥鼠。燕子剛剛救了我們的太陽，否則一切生命都會從世界的表面消"
"失。\n"
"\n"
"#### 日月食\n"
"\n"
"> 一種叫做*Raah*的可怕怪物，嚇到了整個世界。他吞噬了所有阻礙他的人。神"
"*Orchiwaani*有一種神奇的酒。喝了它的人會永生。有一天，*Raah*偷走了酒並喝了"
"它。月亮和太陽抓住了怪物並向 *Orchiwaani*報告。他非常生氣地聽了消息，去和怪物"
"作戰。他幾次切斷了怪物的頭，但因為*Raah*變成永生而自動長出來。他最後切斷了怪"
"物的臀部和尾巴。為了復仇，怪物有時會回來吃月亮或太陽，這就是月食和日食。\n"
"\n"
"當有日食或者月食時，蒙古人知道這意味著*Raah*吞噬月亮或太陽，他們會發出很多噪"
"音，以便怪物釋放出太陽和月亮。在13世紀，Guillaume de Rubruck寫道：\n"
"\n"
"> \"一些[蒙古人]對天文學有所瞭解，並（對其他蒙古人）預測月食和日食。日食發生"
"時，他們演奏鼓和樂器，做大聲吵鬧。日食結束後，他們在喝酒放縱，並舉辦大型聚"
"會。\"\n"
"\n"
"(來源: [#1])\n"
" <p>2008年的日食旅行者仍然目睹了司機和廚師躲在帳篷裡並用鍋子製造噪音。這似乎"
"是真實的，而不是遊客的表演。 還要注意<em> Raah </ em>與印度的 *Rahu*的相似之"
"處。</p>\n"
"\n"
"#### 五星之母\n"
"\n"
"*Hun Tavan Od*（五星之母），也就是仙后座的五顆亮星，象徵著蒙古人的團結，兄弟"
"情誼和團結。星座的五顆星代表成吉思汗的妻子Oulin的五個孩子。\n"
"\n"
"### 與天空相關的其他信仰\n"
"\n"
"根據蒙古傳說，有一個致力於在天空中數清楚一百顆星星的女人夢想著她未來的丈"
"夫。\n"
"\n"
"有時，蒙古人通過向其方向倒牛奶來紀念七佛（*Doloon Burkhan*） 。白色牛奶象徵著"
"蒙古的純潔。他們祈禱，以便可以實現某些事情，但對於一些人而言，這會帶來厄運。"
"牛奶可以用伏特加代替，伏特加雖然是無色的，但卻象徵著蒙古人的黑色。 通過這樣"
"做，它可以避免不幸，爭吵，恐懼，並防止邪惡的心理。\n"
"\n"
"### 結論\n"
"\n"
"這些星座的確受到了西方人的啟發，在這裡簡要介紹的蒙古宇宙觀強調了與之相關的信"
"仰的顯著特徵。 蒙古文化和知識傳播本質上是口頭的，關於這些主題的書面記錄很少。"
"因此，特別難以將其宇宙觀與高保真度和高精度聯繫起來。 為了保留關於這個宇宙觀的"
"知識，歡迎任何評論，建議或合作！\n"
