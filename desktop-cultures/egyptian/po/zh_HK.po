"Late Egyptian astronomy/astrology follows that of Greco/Roman culture. The "
"belief that the stars could influence human destiny does not appear to have "
"reached Egypt until the Ptolemaic period. The temple of Hathor at Denderah "
"dates from Ptolemaic times, probably the first century BCE, and has a "
"wonderful illustration of the sky that illustrates this point."
msgstr ""
"晚期的埃及天文學/占星術遵循希臘/羅馬文化傳統。直到托勒密時期，恒星能影響人類"
"命運的信念才開始到達埃及。丹德拉(Denderah)的哈索爾(Hathor)神廟可以追溯到托勒"
"密時代，可能是西元前一世紀，並且神廟內有一幅黃道十二星座圖很好的說明了這一"
"點。"

"However there were differences in names. For example, Cancer the Crab is "
"represented by the Scarab Beetle. The figure of the Lion near the Scales "
"(which is not the zodiacal Lion) is the constellation Centaurus [#1].\n"
"\n"
"Earlier constellations are more problematic, but some indications exist that "
"some modern zodiac signs are very ancient indeed [#2], although the "
"constellations did change significantly over time [#3].\n"
"\n"
"The Egyptians recognized five planets and called them the \"stars that knew "
"no rest\". Their movement across the heavens reminded the Egyptians of the "
"five gods sailing across the sky in their solar barque (boat). The planet "
"now known as Jupiter was called \"Horus Who Limits the Two Lands\"; Mars was "
"\"Horus of the Horizon\"; Mercury was \"Sebegu\", associated with Set; "
"Saturn was \"Horus the Bull of the Sky\"; and Venus was \"the God of the "
"Morning\" [#7]."

"但是和希臘/羅馬星座相比，埃及星座的名稱存在差異。例如，巨蟹座由金龜子代表。天"
"秤附近獅子的形象（不是黃道上的獅子座）是半人馬座[#1]。\n"
"\n"
"埃及早期的星座問題更多，但有些跡象表明，一些流傳到現在的黃道星座確實非常古老"
"[#2]，即使星座本身隨著時間的推移發生了顯著變化[#3]。\n"
"\n"
"埃及人稱五顆行星為“不知所措的星”。埃及人觀察它們在天球上的運動，認為五個行星"
"是五位神靈駕著太陽船在天空中航行。"
