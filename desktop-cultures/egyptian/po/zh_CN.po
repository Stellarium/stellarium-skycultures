"Late Egyptian astronomy/astrology follows that of Greco/Roman culture. The "
"belief that the stars could influence human destiny does not appear to have "
"reached Egypt until the Ptolemaic period. The temple of Hathor at Denderah "
"dates from Ptolemaic times, probably the first century BCE, and has a "
"wonderful illustration of the sky that illustrates this point."
msgstr ""
"晚期的埃及天文学/占星术遵循希腊/罗马文化传统。直到托勒密时期，恒星能影响人类"
"命运的信念才开始到达埃及。丹达腊(Denderah)的哈索尔(Hathor)神庙可以追溯到托勒"
"密时代，可能是公元前一世纪，并且神庙内有一幅黄道十二星座图很好的说明了这一"
"点。"

"However there were differences in names. For example, Cancer the Crab is "
"represented by the Scarab Beetle. The figure of the Lion near the Scales "
"(which is not the zodiacal Lion) is the constellation Centaurus [#1].\n"
"\n"
"Earlier constellations are more problematic, but some indications exist that "
"some modern zodiac signs are very ancient indeed [#2], although the "
"constellations did change significantly over time [#3].\n"
"\n"
"The Egyptians recognized five planets and called them the \"stars that knew "
"no rest\". Their movement across the heavens reminded the Egyptians of the "
"five gods sailing across the sky in their solar barque (boat). The planet "
"now known as Jupiter was called \"Horus Who Limits the Two Lands\"; Mars was "
"\"Horus of the Horizon\"; Mercury was \"Sebegu\", associated with Set; "
"Saturn was \"Horus the Bull of the Sky\"; and Venus was \"the God of the "
"Morning\" [#7]."

"\n"
"埃及早期的星座问题更多，但有些迹象表明，一些流传到现在的黄道星座确实非常古老"
"[#2]，即使星座本身随着时间的推移发生了显着变化[#3]。\n"

"埃及人称五颗行星为“不知所措的星”。埃及人观察它们在天球上的运动，认为五个行星"
"是五位神灵驾着太阳船在天空中航行。现在被称为木星的行星被称为“限制两块土地的荷"
"鲁斯（Horus）”；火星是“地平线上的荷鲁斯”；水星是“Sebegu”，与赛特（Set）有关；"
"土 星是“天空之牛荷鲁斯”；而维纳斯则是“早晨之神”[#7]。"
