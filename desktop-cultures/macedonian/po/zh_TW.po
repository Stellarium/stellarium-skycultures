"Ethnoastronomical research among Macedonian people began in 1982, organized "
"by the Planetarium at Youth Cultural Centre. In the past years, around 140 "
"villages in Republic of Macedonia have been visited and over 1500 "
"inhabitants have been interviewed and surveyed. All collected information "
"from the population have been published in the book “Sky over "
"Macedonia” (Cenev G, 2004). An integral part of this book is the Sky map of "
"Macedonian people which has been reconstructed based on the descriptions of "
"constellations known to elderly inhabitants of Macedonian villages (Cenev "
"G., 2000)."

"##### Mother Hen (Kvachka) *[Quatʃka]*\n"

"star cluster Pleiades\n"

"\n"
"##### Fox (Lisica) *[Lysitsa]*\n"
"\n"
" Fox is the second by importance natural enemy of the Mother Hen and the "
"Rooster so it is obvious why people also “see” it on the sky. The red color "
"of the bright star Aldebaran from the constellation of the Bull is the "
"reason why people perceive it as a Fox ready to attack the Mother Hen and "
"the Rooster.\n"
"\n"
"##### Pigs (Svinji) *[Sviƞi]*\n"

"\n"
"##### Yoke (Jarem) *[Yarem]*\n"
"\n"
"People under this name recognize group of stars in the constellation "

"that three bright stars and surrounding less bright stars create an image of "
"a wooden Plough with two yoked oxen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wolves (Volci) *[Voltsi]*\n"
"\n"
" Near to the plough with oxen, which is left on a field, people see two "

"the wooden plough that goes into the soil, used for plowing.\n"
"\n"

"fireplace to support pans and kettles while preparing food.\n"
