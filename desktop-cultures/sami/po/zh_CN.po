"### Sources\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark[#3], who "
"based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and author Johan "
"Turi.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a conglomeration of at least three slightly different "
"cultures from the people of the South-Sami, North-Sami and Russian Sami. "
"Each of these groups have slightly different languages and as such there may "
"be small differences with some references.\n"
"\n"
"Sami constellations can be observed on Sami artifacts connected to the old "
"religion, suggesting that the night sky played an important cultural role "
"for Sami peoples in years gone by.\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture has a lot in common with other arctic and sub-arctic "
"cultures in Eurasia. One unfortunate similarity is that much of the culture "
"was lost before it was recorded properly.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and Stars\n"
"\n"
"The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing "
"during the 19th century. In is unclear if the written record is complete. "
"The constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant "
"constellation, *Sarva* &mdash; the elk. Sarva is the Sami name for elk, an "
"alternative name is *Sarvvis* &mdash; Bull elk. The origin of this "
"constellation probably dates back to the old hunter culture before reindeer "
"were domesticated.\n"
"\n"
"*Sarva* consists of the Western constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts "
"of Auriga. Constellations and stars surrounding Sarva represent hunters of "
"the elk. *Favdna* (also transcribed as *Favtna*) is the star Arcturus, and "
"represents the Hunter who aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (*Fauna "
"davgge* &mdash; the Big Dipper). Favdna must aim well, for if he hits the "
"Sky Support *Boahjenaste* (the star Polaris), legend has it that the world "
"will come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"Favdna has a number of helpers: *Galla* (Procyon<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>) and "
"his sons *Gallabarneck* (Orion's belt), the \"Ski Runners\", *Cuoigahægjek* "
"(Castor and Pollux) and \"The Runner\" (Vega). The Pleiades are called "
"*Rougot* (dog pack) or *Miese-cora* (calfpack).\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called *Lodde-raiddaras* (lit. bird path) or *Jakke-mærka* "
"(lit. year mark). The name used depends on the season. In the sky chart of "
"Johan Turi, one can observe a star *Guovso-naste*, morning star, that can be "
"identified as Venus, but this is not certain as it can also be identified as "
"Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in "
"the Norse skyculture).\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture does not have a large number of constellations. This is "
"thought to be mainly because of the high Northerly latitude of the Sami "
"people's range. Two factors contribute to this: that the Southern sky stays "
"below the horizon to a large extent, and that the Aurora Borealis is "
"frequently bright enough to obscure many stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Notes\n"
"\n"
" 1. <a name=\"note1\"/>The exact star which represents *Galla* "
"is uncertain. it is probably Procyon, Rigel or Sirius - Procyon was chosen "
"as Galla for this sky culture since Sirius is very hard to spot from the "
"latitude where the Sami live."

"### 来源\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium的萨米星空文化基于Bo Lundmark [#3]。他的作品主要以萨米裔艺术家和作"
"家Johan Turi的作品为基础。\n"
"\n"
"此星空文化是由南萨米人、北萨米人和俄罗斯萨米人，至少三种略有不同的文化综合"
"的。因此与某些参考文献可能会有小的差异。\n"
"\n"
"萨米星座可以在与古老宗教相关的萨米文物上看到，这说明夜空在萨米人过去的文化生"
"活中有重要的作用。\n"
"\n"
"萨米星空文化与欧亚大陆的其他北极和亚北极文化有很多共同点。一个不幸的相似之处"
"是许多正式记录已经失传了。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座和恒星\n"
"\n"
"萨米人星座可能很古老，但在19世纪才有书面记录，而且还不清楚记录的是否完整。这"
"里包括的星座和恒星都与占主导地位的星座*Sarva* &mdash;（驼鹿）有关。这个星座的"
"起源可追溯到驼鹿被驯化之前的古老狩猎文化。\n"
"\n"
"*Sarva* 星座由西方星座仙后座、英仙座和部分御夫座组成。周围的星座和恒星代表狩"
"猎驼鹿的猎手。*Favdna* (也称为 *Favtna*) 是大角星，代表着用弓箭(*Fauna "
"davgge* &mdash; 北斗)瞄准驼鹿的猎人。 Favdna必须瞄准，如果他射中了天空支柱 "
"*Boahjenaste* (北极星)，传说世界将会终结。\n"
"\n"
"Favdna有很多帮手: *Galla* (南河三<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>) 和他的儿子 "
"*Gallabarneck* (猎户座腰带)，滑雪者 *Cuoigahægjek* (北河二和北河三)和 \"跑步"
"者\" (织女星)。昴星团被叫做*Rougot* (狗群) 或者 *Miese-cora* (牛犊群)。\n"
"\n"
"银河被称为 *Lodde-raiddaras* (发光的鸟径) or *Jakke-mærka* (发光的年标)。在 "
"Johan Turi的星图中，可以找到一颗叫晨星*Guovso-naste*的星，他可能是金星，但也"
"可能是河鼓二。它预示晨曦即将到来。\n"
"\n"
"萨米人没有很多星座。因为萨米人的活动纬度太高，以至于南天极大部分永久的在地平"
"线以下，而北极光又经常明亮到足以遮蔽许多恒星。\n"
"\n"
"### 注释\n"
"\n"
" 1. <a name=\"note1\"/>代表 *Galla* 的恒星尚不确定。 它可能是南河"
"三，参宿七或天狼星。这里选南河三做代表，因为天狼星很难从萨米人居住的纬度中发"
"现。"
