"In some circumstances separation of individual star names from &quot;star "
"path&quot; names cannot be resolved. A star may have multiple names 1) if "
"the star is part of numerous star paths and 2) since the naming of stars can "
"differ depending on which Tongan island group it originates from. The "
"nomenclature of stars is approximated based on the limited resources "
"available.\n"
"\n"
"Whilst the most-notable/common stars and constellations (i.e. Orion, "
"Pleiades, Crux) are identified in Tongan star lore there are two notable "
"exceptions. There is an absence of naming of the North star (Polaris: "
"&alpha; UMi). This is peculiar considering the latitude of the Tongan "
"islands and the prominence of this star at certain times of the year. In the "
"event of any northerly journeys from Tonga such an important navigational "
"landmark could not have possibly gone unnoticed. The constellation of "
"Scorpio (parts in, or stars of) are also absent from Tongan star lore. This "
"is surprising since the vast majority of star lore &ndash; globally and "
"Polynesian &ndash; has Scorpio as a central constellation due to it being "
"easily identified and that it is nearly directly opposite Orion in the night "
"sky. [Stellarium would welcome any further knowledge on these two "
"anomalies.]\n"
"\n"
"Common ancestry of Polynesian star lore's is evident in the similarities in "
"the labelling of stars. For example the Pleiades is called Mataliki in "
"Tongan, Matariki in Maori and Makali`i in Hawaiian.\n"
