"Belt as Mamalhuaztli, and it represented the wood sticks used to light the "
"new fire in the commemoration celebrated every 52 years by the Mexicans and "

"the Mexicas <em>Tianquiztli</em>, which means market, perhaps because of the "
"crowd that gathers on them, they're generally represented by one or two "
"people inside a circle with goods.</p>\n"

"\"107\" align=\"left\" />The constellation of Gemini was called "
"<em>Citlaltlachtli</em>, which means the ball game of the stars. This game "
"was endowed with a ritual significance and used a natural rubber ball. It is "
"said that the movement of the ball within the playing field refers to the "
"movement of the sun and moon.</p>\n"
"\n"
"### Xonecuilli\n"
"\n"
"<p><img src=\"illustrations/xonecuilli_t.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"107\" "
"align=\"left\" />The Ursa Minor constellation is identified as "
"<em>Xonecuilli</em> which means twisted foot, and is related to Nanahuatzin, "
"this character is represented with twisted feet, filled with boils and "
"sores, this sick and poor God sacrificed himself to become <em>Tonatiuh</em> "
"the Sun god.</p>\n"

"\"100\" align=\"left\" />According to the Florentino Codex Sahagun's "
"informants identified a group of stars known as <em>Citlalcolotl</em>, the "
"scorpion star. In turn, Tezozomoc also mentions the scorpion star  and he "
