"Shown here are some interesting folk astronomy constellations found in "
"Belarus, a country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, "
"Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the "
"northwest. Belarus is landlocked and contains large tracts of marshy land "
"and thousands of lakes. Forests cover about 40% of the country. Belarus is "
"exceptional in that people in the villages have preserved their traditional "
"knowledge about the stars and related beliefs, right through to the present "
"time. The illustrations are by no means exhaustive. In fact, many asterisms "
"have multiple recorded meanings, ranging from ancient to Christianized."

"这里展示的是白罗斯发现的一些有趣的民间天文星座。白罗斯东北与俄罗斯接壤，南接"
"乌克兰，西接波兰，西北接着立陶宛和拉脱维亚。 白罗斯是内陆地区，拥有大片沼泽地"
"和数千个湖泊。 森林覆盖了全国约40％的土地。村庄里的人们一直保留着关于星星和相"
"关信仰的传统知识。插图并非详尽无遗。事实上，从上古时代到基督教时代，许多星座"
"有多种记载和意义。"
