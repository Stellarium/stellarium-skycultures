"Shown here are some interesting folk astronomy constellations found in "
"Belarus, a country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, "
"Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the "
"northwest. Belarus is landlocked and contains large tracts of marshy land "
"and thousands of lakes. Forests cover about 40% of the country. Belarus is "
"exceptional in that people in the villages have preserved their traditional "
"knowledge about the stars and related beliefs, right through to the present "
"time. The illustrations are by no means exhaustive. In fact, many asterisms "
"have multiple recorded meanings, ranging from ancient to Christianized."

"這裡展示的是白俄羅斯發現的一些有趣的民間天文星座。白俄羅斯東北與俄羅斯接壤，"
"南接烏克蘭，西接波蘭，西北接著立陶宛和拉脫維亞。 白俄羅斯是內陸地區，擁有大片"
"沼澤地和數千個湖泊。 森林覆蓋了全國約40％的土地。村莊裡的人們一直保留著關於星"
"星和相關信仰的傳統知識。插圖並非詳盡無遺。事實上，從上古時代到基督教時代，許"
"多星座有多種記載和意義。"
