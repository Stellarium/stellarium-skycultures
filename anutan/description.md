# Anutan

## Introduction

Anuta is a small island in the SE of Solomon Islands in Melanesia, inhabited by a culturally Polynesian society. As for most Oceanic seafarers, the stars are the most important tool for long-range navigation. The major guiding stars and constellations are known as `carriers` (_kaavenga_), and have proper names. A `star path` or sequence of stars (_kau panonga porau_) is followed from one island to the next. 

This sky culture has 11 constellation line figures, and names for 6 stars, the Pleiades, Venus, the Milky Way, and the Magellanic Clouds. Two other groups of stars are mentioned in the source, but are not identifiable.

## Description

This sky culture for Stellarium is a transcript of the information in [#1]. Research on which [#1] is based was conducted in the Solomon Islands during a period of fourteen months in 1972–1973 and five months in 1983–1984.

### Constellations and star names

The dominant constellation is `Bird of Flight` (_Manu_), which can be seen in all seasons. The Anutan assign symbolic prominence to birds: canoes are likened to birds, the sky is dominated by the `Bird of Flight`, and voyagers are metaphorically depicted as birds in poetry and song [#1]. Sirius is `The Bird's Body` (_Te Tino A Manu_), Canopus is `The East Wing` (_Te Kapakau Tonga_), and Procyon is `The North Wing` (_Te Kapakau Pakatokerau_).

Other culturally significant themes reflected in Anutan constellations include food, fish, and equipment used to procure or prepare these items [#1]. One of the constellations along the star path to the island of Tikopia is `Crevalle-like Fish` (_Te Paka Poi Ika Tapu_), whose identification is uncertain. The Southern Cross is identified as `Sacred Wood` or `Sacred Timber` (_Te Rakau Tapu_); in pre-Christian times, it was `The Net` (_Te Kupenga_), which is the name used in this dataset. Alpha and Beta Centauri are either `The Double Man` (_Te Rua Tangata_) or are associated with the nearby Southern Cross, in which case they are called `The Net’s Handle` (_Te Kau O Te Kupenga_). A part of Aries, a curved line of three stars, is known as `Octopus Tentacle` (_Kaavei_). Grus, a curved line of five stars, is `The Bamboo` (_Te Kope_), from which fishing poles, sailing masts, yards, booms, and outrigger supports are made. Antares and the surrounding stars of Scorpius are called `Taro Plant` (_Taro_). Altair is `The Carrying Stick` (_Te Aamonga_), used to carry taro, coconuts, or other food. Taurus’s forehead is `The Tongs` (_Te Angaanga_), used for moving hot stones, coals, and food in an oven. Delphinus is `Adze` (_Toki_), used for cutting canoes and building houses. 

Other major constellations are not associated directly with these themes. Orion’s belt is `Path of Three` (_Ara Toru_). The Pleiades are `Small Face` or `Small Eyes` (_Matariki_).

Many of these constellations are identified by similar names on other islands.

### Planets

Venus is both `The Morning Star` (_Te Petuu Ao_) and `The Evening Star` (_Tiuriuri_). The latter is not certain.

### Other sky objects

The Milky Way is known as _Te Tukaniva_ (no translation provided). The Large and Small Magellanic Cloud are named `The Running Cloud` and `The Restrained Cloud`.
