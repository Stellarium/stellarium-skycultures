# Description of Kamilaroi/Euahlayi constellation Gawaargay
msgid ""
"Gawaargay is the spirit Emu in the Sky, located with its head in the Coal Sack,\n"
"and its neck and body stretching out through the dust lanes of the Milky Way\n"
"(Warrambul) past Scorpius. The Euahlayi and the Kamilaroi see it with legs in\n"
"April and May, when it is female and chasing the males. From June to August it\n"
"is male and sitting on its nest without legs (the males brood the chicks), and\n"
"this is a signal to collect the eggs. In the evening in late August it is\n"
"vertical in the sky, and the head and body form two \"eggs\", meaning the eggs\n"
"should not be collected. Later in the year, it appears on the horizon, so it is\n"
"believed to be sitting in a waterhole, meaning the waterholes are full. When it\n"
"is below the horizon, then it is on Earth as the Black Emu, which is rarely\n"
"seen."
