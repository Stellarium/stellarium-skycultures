# Northeast America (Sioux)

## Introduction

The Sioux are several tribes in the Northeast American cultural group (United States and Canada), They formed a first "nation" known as the Oceti Sakowin – Seven (Council) Fires. This council of seven consists of: four Dakota bands, two Nakota bands and one Lakota band, where D/N/L are dialectic distinctions. The word D(N/L)akota means "Alliance". Also known as Sioux or the Sioux Nation.

## Description

The term "Sioux" was possibly impolite: It stems from colonial time and is a French shortform of the Ojibwe word "Nadouessioux" meaning "little snakes" which was a metaphor for enemies of the Ojibwe. The correct term is Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota are one of the groups of indigenous people of north-central. Well known for following the buffalo.
