# Dakota/Lakota/Nakota

## Introduction

Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota are one of the groups of indigenous people of north-central United States and Canada. Known as the Oceti Sakowin – Seven (Council) Fires. This council of seven consists of: four Dakota bands, two Nakota bands and one Lakota band, where D/N/L are dialectic distinctions. Well known for following the buffalo. The word D(N/L)akota means "Alliance". Also known as Sioux or the Sioux Nation.
