"The Vedic sky culture shows some similiarities with the Parthian one, e.g. some\n"
"commonly known constellations related to lunar mansions, called _Nakṣatra_-s.\n"
"\n"
"### Rāśi (राशिः)\n"
"\n"
"The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical\n"
"zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is\n"
"called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).\n"
"\n"
"In Vedic astronomy there are two systems of measuring time: the lunar calendar\n"
"and the solar calendar. In both cases one year is divided into 12 months or\n"
"\"māsā\". The names of the solar months originated from these constellation's\n"
"names.\n"
"\n"
"### Nakṣatra (नक्षत्रम्)\n"
"\n"
"In Hindu tradition the ecliptic is divided into 27 parts of approximately\n"
"13°20\", mirroring the siderial month and corresponding to 27 asterisms known as\n"
"the _nakṣatra_-s [#4]. In the earliest extant layers of the tradition this\n"
"number was made 28. This division is critical for several purposes including\n"
"timing rituals and determining the birth lunar mansions. Since these asterisms\n"
"define an area in the sky, technically they are also constellations.\n"
"\n"
"Surya Siddhanta and Vedanga-Jyotisha specify start coordinates for the 13°20\"\n"
"divisions using some stars [#2].\n"
"\n"
"The earliest complete lists of _nakṣatra_ are found in the _Taittirīya-śruti_\n"
"and the _Atharvaveda_ where they are recited as part of the _nakṣatreṣṭi_\n"
"ritual which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments.\n"
"Some scholars opine that the tradition shows that by the early medieval period,\n"
"the _nakṣatra_ identification had changed to a small degree from the Vedic\n"
"period.\n"
"\n"
"In mythology the Nakshatras are considered to be the 27 daughters of Daksha\n"
"Prajipati and wives of Chandra, the god of moon. Daksha found that Soma\n"
"(=Chandra) overly favored one daughter (rohinī) over the others, thus\n"
"neglecting their needs and flouting his responsibilities. For this, Daksha\n"
"cursed him to wither and die. Chandra Dev approached and worshipped Lord Shiva\n"
"in order to be relieved of the curse. He gave Chandra the boon that in a lunar\n"
"month, he would grow for fifteen days (or \"Pakshā\") in one half and in the\n"
"other half he would keep losing one shade (or \"Kalā\") per lunar day (or\n"
"\"tithi\") and decrease in size.\n"
"\n"
"The names of the lunar months originated from those 12 division names in which\n"
"full moon or \"Purnimā\" occurs. Unlike a solar day which is defined by a sunrise\n"
"to next sunrise, a lunar day or moon's position in a nakshatra doesn't depends\n"
"on the Sun's or Moon's rise. Thus a lunar day may start at any time of a solar\n"
"day. Like other ancient human cultures, Vedic people invented a number of\n"
"systems for intercalation of lunar months, i.e. adding another month every 32.5\n"
"months on average or 4 months in every 11 years to correct the mismatch between\n"
"lunar and solar year.\n"

"A few of the _yogatārā_-s or prominent asterisms in the _nakṣatra_-s (going by\n"
"their mainstream identification) lie slightly outside their constellation\n"
"boundaries. In these cases, any resultant problem (with regards to ritual\n"
"timing or astrology) should be solved by other means, e.g. some people propose\n"
"alternate identifications for such _yogatārā_-s.\n"

"### Navagraha - Nine planets\n"
"\n"
"They observed that some celestial bodies move independently relative to the\n"
"background stars; they named them planets or \"graha\". By this definition\n"
"(moving), the Sun and Moon are also treated as _graha_ or planet. The Vedic\n"
"also named the lunar nodes as planets as these points are very inportant to\n"
"calculate the eclipses. The name of Vedic days originated from these planet's\n"
"names.\n"
