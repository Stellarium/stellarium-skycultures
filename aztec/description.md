# Aztec

## Introduction

The Aztecs were an indigene group of peoples in Mesoamerica, especially central parts of Mexico. Their culture flourished from 13th to 15th century and was redeemed during the European invasion. As a consequence, a large part of Aztec knowledge was lost in the 16th century.

## Description

For ancient Aztecs, the knowledge of the night sky and star's movement had great importance for their calendars and the measurement of both agricultural and sacred cycles. The elements of the Aztec society such as culture, economy and science is preserved in the _tlacuilos_. This term loans from _tlacuiloa_, a word in the ancient Aztec language (Nahuatl,[#12],[#13]) that means _writing with drawings_. These Tlacuilos where stored in the _amoxcalli_ (books) and _calli_ (house). Later, they became known as _codices_; a word that came from the Latin word Codex meaning 'written book'. They were drawn in many different materials such as deer skin, _amate_ (paper) or cotton fabric and they had no text only drawings called _glifos_ [#5],[#6]. 

Although, many of the pre-hispanic Codices were destroyed during the Spanish conquest, some native Americans and some Spanish priests have been working for keeping collections and continuing the Mesoamerican customs from earlier epochs. In the newly produced Colonial Codices, there is a change of the drawing style because of new techniques and the new materials imported from Europe. Additionally, descriptive text in these new manuscripts have been written in a mixture of both languages, Spanish and Nahuatl.

Unfortunately, there is only little astronomical knowledge of the Aztec preserved in the remaining codexes. The figure is one of the few that shows names of some constellations and astronomical phenomena identified by the Aztec. It belong to the _Primeros Memoriales_ (first memorials), a colonial manuscript of the 16th century written by Fray Bernardino de Sahagun.

## Constellations

**Mamalhuaztli**

Ancient Aztec named Orion's Belt 'Mamalhuaztli'. It represented the wood sticks used to light the new fire in the commemoration celebrated every 52 years by the Mexicans and their neighbors. This celebration was named _toxiuh molpilia_ which means 'binding of the years' and coincided with the beginning of the new year named _xiuhtzitzquilo_.

**Tianquiztli**

For the Mexicans, the group of stars known as Pleiades symbolized _Tianquiztli_ (the Market), perhaps because of the crowd that gathers on them. Normally, they are represented by one or two people inside a circle with goods.

Nowadays, in Mexico the informal market or street markets are called _Tianguis_.

**Citlaltlachtli**

The constellation of Gemini was called _Citlaltlachtli_, which means the ball game of the stars. This game was endowed with a ritual significance and used a natural rubber ball. It is said that the movement of the ball within the playing field refers to the movement of the Sun and Moon.

**Xonecuilli**

The constellation of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, is identified as _Xonecuilli_ (the Twisted foot). It is related to _Nanahuatzin_, a character represented with twisted feet, filled with boils and sores. This sick and poor God sacrificed himself to become _Tonatiuh_, the Sun god.

Apparently, this constellation name can also be associated with the Southern Cross and its surrounding stars (especially in texts by Tezozomoc). The Spanish missionary priest Sahagún reports [#7], the shape of this constellations resembles a bread in the form of the letter S and it is called _xonecuilli_ by the Aztecs.

**Colotl Ixayac**

According to the Florentino Codex, Sahagun's informants identified a group of stars known as _Citlalcolotl_ with the stars of the Scorpion. In turn, Tezozomoc also mentions the scorpion star and he called it _Colotlixayac_, which means face of a scorpion.

![Paris Codex](colotlixayac_image.webp)
In a section of the Paris Codex called zodiac pages [#3],[#10], the scorpion is also mentioned. In this codex the icons shows figures of animals hanging from the body of the Celestial Dragon.

## Conclusion

It is noteworthy that the interpretation of some of these constellations are still in discussion, and of course there must be other constellations to represent. Any comments and/or collaboration are welcome in order to preserve the stellar knowledge, myths and starlore of the Aztec culture.
