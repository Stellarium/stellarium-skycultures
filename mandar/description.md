# Mandar

## Introduction

The Mandar are an ethnic group on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, with a strong seafaring and trading tradition. The sailors used stars and asterisms to pinpoint the cardinal directions. This sky culture has 6 constellation line figures, names for 3 other identified sky objects (the Pleiades, the Milky Way, and Venus), and the name of an unidentified sky object. The constellations reflect the seafaring tradition.

## Description

This sky culture for Stellarium is a transcript of data recorded in [#1]. This data was collected through interviews with retired fishermen.

The Bugis sky culture is related (they are neighbouring ethnic groups on the island of Sulawesi) so it is similar.

### Constellations and star names

`Slanted House` (_Bittoéng Sapo Kepang_) is used as an indicator for the south. Five stars (including Crux) form a house with uneven foundations.

`Widow` (_Bittoéng Tuwallu_) is a pair of stars just below the `Slanted House`, so also a sign for the south direction. Although source [#1] doesn't link the two stars with a line, the equivalent Bugis data does in [#2]. They are linked here.

`Shark` (_Bittoéng Mangiwang_) is an asterism which marks the entry of the northwest monsoon season. There is a triangular  fin in the middle, and a tail at the back. The drawing in [#1] has a large open mouth, but no star is identified for the back of the mouth, so none is included here (the mouth is closed). 

`Stingray` (_Bittoéng Lambaru_) also marks the entry of the northwest monsoon season. There is a head (with two eyes, which are not linked by lines to the head) and a tail.

`Fishing Net` (_Bittoéng Panjala_) is used as an indicator of the entry of the cool season (between the two monsoons) and the appearance of the bambang fish. It consists of fishermen and a boat.

`Group of Three Stars` (_Bittoéng Tallu-tallu_) are two groups of stars that each have three stars in line. These stars are a mark towards the east from the Pleiades. The stars are not linked into lines in [#1], but are linked here, since they're described as being "in line".

The Pleiades (_Bittoéng Malunus_, which has no special meaning) are used as a sign of increasing number of flying fish in the Makassar Strait during the southeast monsoon season. 

### Planets

Venus is `Pig` (_Bittoéng Bawi_). This star is used by mountain people as a mark that pigs will come out looking for food. 

Venus is also called `Star Carrying the Sun` (_Bittoéng Pambawa Allo_). It is a sign that the Sun will rise about an hour later.

### Other sky objects

An unidentified sky object called `Star of Fishermen` (_Bittoéng Pambosei_) is a marker towards the north. This star  usually appears in February, during the northwest monsoon season.

`Dragon` (_Bittoéng Naga_) is the Milky Way. It is used by fishermen to find a good fishing location. It usually rises in the southeast, and when it disappears, fishermen are afraid that strong winds will appear.
