# Book Of The Stars (Traditional Arabic)

## Introduction
This sky culture reflects the traditional Arabic star names, constellations and asterisms identified by the prominent astronomer: al-Ṣūfī in his _Book of the stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب), written in the 10th century. The book maps the Arab names to the respective stars of the 48 classical Greek constellations in Ptolemy's Almagest.

## Description
_Book Of The Stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب) is an astronomical book written shortly before 964 by the astronomer Abu al-Ḥusayn ʻAbd Al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Ṣūfī (born in Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Ṣūfī.

An important aspect of al-Ṣūfī book is his record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under each constellation, and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars. This means that we are looking at two layers of stars knowledge at the same time: the Ptolemaic one and the indigenous Arab one. The Ptolemaic layer is represented in this sky culture by the images of the classical Greek constellations, while the indigenous Arab star knowledge layer is represented by asterism and constellation lines accompanied by indigenous Arab star names.

The sky culture images were extracted from the Ulugh Beg manuscript of the _The book of the stars_ [^1], and adapted for Stellarium by Mr. Kutaibaa Akraa.

The single source of the sky culture is the _The book of the stars_ and the aim is to give a faithful representation of the book content.

## Constellations
This sky culture displays the Arabic constellations as lines superimposed on the images of the Ptolemaic constellations according to al-Sufi description in his _The book of the stars_. All Arabic names of the stars mentioned by al-Sufi are included.

### Compilation of the sky culture
This sky culture is a result of research done on manuscripts of al-Ṣūfī book, oldest of which is the [Oxford, Bodleian Library Ms. Marsh 144 dated 1009 AD](https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/viewer/c1caa84c-f6d2-483f-9eb4-2439cccdc801#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=25&r=0&xywh=-4815%2C-378%2C14782%2C7535).
Ten manuscripts of the _The Book Of The Stars_ were consulted to produce the most accurate text as was written by al-Ṣūfī. Then, each member star of the 48 constellations was identified according to al-Ṣūfī description, and new tables were built including modern star designations from the Hipparcos, Bright stars, and Bayer catalogues. In addition, Arab indigenous star names were collected and identified as mapped by al-Ṣūfī to the Ptolemaic ones. All the previous steps were included in a book published digitally of the _The Book Of The Stars_ plus explanations and commentary by Khalid al-Ajaji, the author of this sky culture[^2].
