# Book Of The Stars (Traditional Arabic)

## Introduction

This sky culture reflects the traditional Arabic star names, constellations and
asterisms identified by the prominent astronomer: al-Ṣūfī in his _Book of the
stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب), written in the 10th century. The book maps the
Arab names to the respective stars of the 48 classical Greek constellations in
Ptolemy's Almagest.

## Description

_Book Of The Stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب) is an astronomical book written
shortly before 964 by the astronomer Abu al-Ḥusayn ʻAbd Al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar
al-Ṣūfī (born in Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Ṣūfī.

An important aspect of al-Ṣūfī book is his record of the indigenous Arabic star
names falling under each constellation, and the exact identification of the
respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars. This means that we are
looking at two layers of stars knowledge at the same time: the Ptolemaic one
and the indigenous Arab one. The Ptolemaic layer is represented in this sky
culture by the images of the classical Greek constellations, while the
indigenous Arab star knowledge layer is represented by asterism and
constellation lines accompanied by indigenous Arab star names.

The sky culture images were extracted from the Ulugh Beg manuscript of the _The
book of the stars_ [#1], and adapted for Stellarium by Mr. Kutaibaa Akraa.

The single source of the sky culture is the _The book of the stars_ and the aim
is to give a faithful representation of the book content.

### Constellations

This sky culture displays the Arabic constellations as lines superimposed on
the images of the Ptolemaic constellations according to al-Sufi description in
his _The book of the stars_. All Arabic names of the stars mentioned by al-Sufi
are included.

### Compilation of the sky culture

This sky culture is a result of research done on manuscripts of al-Ṣūfī book,
oldest of which is the [Oxford, Bodleian Library Ms. Marsh 144 dated 1009
AD](https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/viewer/c1caa84c-f6d2-483f-9eb4-2439cccdc801#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=25&r=0&xywh=-4815%2C-378%2C14782%2C7535).
Ten manuscripts of the _The Book Of The Stars_ were consulted to produce the
most accurate text as was written by al-Ṣūfī. Then, each member star of the 48
constellations was identified according to al-Ṣūfī description, and new tables
were built including modern star designations from the Hipparcos, Bright stars,
and Bayer catalogues. In addition, Arab indigenous star names were collected
and identified as mapped by al-Ṣūfī to the Ptolemaic ones. All the previous
steps were included in a book published digitally of the _The Book Of The
Stars_ plus explanations and commentary by Khalid al-Ajaji, the author of this
sky culture[#2].
