"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental\n"
"civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars\n"
"considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely\n"
"influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous\n"
"myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are\n"
"the main themes of this sky culture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably\n"
"to link with the excellent observing conditions for whom they benefit even now.\n"
"In the past, the necessity for Mogolians to move and to get one's bearing even\n"
"during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements\n"
"which developed their imagination facing the sky.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is\n"
"symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms\n"
"are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the\n"
"Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called\n"
"_Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer\n"
"triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_\n"
"inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the\n"
"five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond\n"
"Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era.\n"
"\n"
"Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day\n"
"of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and\n"
"the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some\n"
"peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday),\n"
"Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_\n"
"(associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday),\n"
"Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last,\n"
"invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the\n"
"characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating\n"
"the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the\n"
"name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar\n"
"designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto'\n"
"Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the\n"
"Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus,\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun,\n"
"_Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real\n"
"equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of\n"
"the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in\n"
"India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an\n"
"unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
"It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating\n"
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, the Milky Way is named\n"
"_Tengeriin Zadas_ which could literally be translated as the Sky Line\n"
"(_Tengeriin_, the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_, the\n"
"line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above\n"
"Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was\n"
"placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an\n"
"archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to\n"
"discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
"From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to\n"
"_Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer,\n"
"mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia.\n"
"Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and\n"
"astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely\n"
"measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters\n"
"radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is\n"
"limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and\n"
"body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding\n"
"> capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it\n"
"> peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked\n"
"> the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to\n"
"> rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went\n"
"> together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched\n"
"> for the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and\n"
"> killed it. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to\n"
"> the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded\n"
"> and changed immediately into the North Star. The seven others changed into\n"
"> the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night.\n"
"> The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to\n"
"> appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian\n"
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to\n"
"every Mongolian depending on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese\n"
"and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a\n"
"lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and is associated with a\n"
"star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds\n"
"to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the\n"
"ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the\n"
"year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the\n"
"sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese\n"
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail\n"
"are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There\n"
"however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e.,\n"
"Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
"Shooting stars have also a specific meaning for Mongolians: they are\n"
"personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they\n"
"imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes\n"
"somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\n"
"\"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of\n"
"the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
"Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan\n"
"Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by\n"
"most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry\n"
"> meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good\n"
"> archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without\n"
"> missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the\n"
"> fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to\n"
"> ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first\n"
"> arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed\n"
"> the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when\n"
"> a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man\n"
"> had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers\n"
"> and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all\n"
"> life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the\n"
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist\n"
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the\n"
"> entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_\n"
"> owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_\n"
"> stole the magic spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in\n"
"> the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this\n"
"> piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it\n"
"> grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended\n"
"> to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly.\n"
"> Just as _Orchiwaani_ had seized the monster to finish it off, it escaped and\n"
"> disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to\n"
"> help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the\n"
"> monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always\n"
"> immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar\n"
"> eclipses.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the\n"
"Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to\n"
"liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote [#1]:\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to\n"
"> other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to\n"
"> produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of\n"
"> their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and\n"
"> instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they\n"
"> devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their\n"
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the\n"
"tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the\n"
"Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children\n"
"of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their\n"
"> mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a\n"
"> knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other,\n"
"> and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots\n"
"> withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the\n"
"> rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred\n"
"stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk\n"
"in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They\n"
"pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just\n"
"one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka\n"
"which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for\n"
"Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off\n"
"evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian\n"
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which\n"
"are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is\n"
"essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is\n"
"therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and\n"
"precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every\n"
"observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

msgstr ""
"蒙古星座和宇宙論是從西方文明中繼承而來的，尤其是與亞歷山大大帝的接觸，亞歷山大大帝的學者認為巴比倫的星體科學是最高標準。它在很大程度上也受到了中華文明和佛教宗教的影響，從而產生了許多與周圍環境有關的神話和信仰。當地的野生動植物是這種天空文化的主題。他們具有豐富的宇宙色彩，可能與他們即使現在仍然受益的優良觀測條件有關。過去，蒙古人甚至在夜間和不同季節都必須移動並承擔責任，這可能是他們面對天空發展想像力的因素之一。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"通常，星星代表圍繞北極星旋轉的動物，北極星由金色棍子（Altan Hadaas）象徵。幾乎所有蒙古星號都與現代星號相似，但其中一些有著不同的名稱，例如：天鵝被稱為Num Sum（弓箭），而北斗七星則被稱為Doloon Burkhan。在蒙古人的想像中，夏季三角形的星星（即Vega，Deneb和Altair）指的是三個鹿角（蒙古人的Gurvan Maral Od），仙后座則代表五顆星星的女人（Hun Tavan Od）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星和恆星\n"
"\n"
"最初，西藏-蒙古占星術計算五個肉眼行星（水星，金星，火星，木星，土星）中每個行星的位置：在遙遠的衛星時代，土星以外的行星未被識別。\n"
"\n"
"與羅馬文化一樣，蒙古人將這五顆行星歸因於一周中的每一天，以星期日（Nar）為星期日和月亮（Sar）為一周完成了為期七天的工作。太陽系行星的名稱在蒙古語中有一些特殊之處。水星被命名為芽（與週三相關），金星，糖（與週五相關），地球，德爾基，火星，安加拉格（與週二相關），木星，巴爾哈斯巴迪（與週四相關），土星，桑契爾（與週六相關） 。天王星的術語是Tengeriin-van，海王星Dalai-van。我們可以看到，肉眼看不見的最後兩個，在很長一段時間後才被發現，它們的特徵是名稱末尾帶有粒子-van，表明蒙古語中的王子身份。地球名稱上沒有這個粒子，但是矮行星冥王星（蒙古語中的Dalkhii-van）具有非常相似的名稱，並且包括這個粒子。冥王星的蒙古語名字可能被翻譯成“王子的土地”。它就像地球，但不是地球（行星），而是我們行走的地面/表面。 Tengeriin-van的天王星可以被翻譯成“王子的天空”，而Dalai-van的Neptun可以被翻譯成“王子的海洋”。儘管如此，這個粒子在英語中並沒有真正的等價物，並且上面的翻譯被提出以對行星名稱的含義有所了解。這些名稱來自梵語（印度使用的語言），並且在蒙古語中以目前的語言廣泛使用，但以非官方的方式使用。\n"
"\n"
"看到指定其他天體的術語與它們的信仰之間的緊密聯繫也很有趣：的確，銀河係被命名為Tengeriin Zadas，字面上可以翻譯為“天空線”（Tengeriin，天空，這也意味著天神）。天空，以及Zadas，直線）。蒙古巨星傳說中最著名的是阿爾科（Alcor），那顆巨熊位於米薩爾（Mizar）的上方。它像徵著恢復與保護之星。它是由Tengeriin（天堂之神）放置在這裡的，以保護Mizar。要成為成吉思汗（13世紀）的弓箭手，似乎必須能夠用肉眼辨認這兩顆星星。\n"
"\n"
"從歷史的角度來看，對天空的出色了解可以追溯到烏魯格·貝格（Ulug Beg，公元1394-1449；他的真名Taraghay），撒馬爾罕的天文學家，數學家和副國王。他的帝國擴展到中亞。他放棄了王室職責，研究了當時的天體和天文問題。他是第一個以半徑40米的六分儀極其精確地測量土星的革命時期（Sanchir）的人。\n"
"\n"
"### 神話傳說\n"
"\n"
"#### 大熊\n"
"\n"
"蒙古人特別喜歡大熊熊。對於他們來說，這個星座僅限於七星組成熊的尾巴和身體的七星，關於它的傳說可能是蒙古最著名的。\n"
"\n"
">曾幾何時，一個王國中生活著八位天賦卓越的孤兒兄弟。國王和王后和平地生活在其中。一天，一個怪物來綁架了女王。國王請八兄弟把她帶回來，並說：“如果你們中的一個人成功救了我心愛的人，我會給他一個金色的箭”。孤兒們一起去協助女王。他們花了兩天三夜尋找怪物。然後，在第三天深夜，他們發現並殺死了它。他們把女王帶回了城堡。\n"
">國王沒有將箭切成八部分，他決定將箭扔向天空。第一個抓住它的人可以保留它。最小的兄弟成功了，並立即變成了北極星。其他七個人變成了七個神，七個佛陀每晚都拜訪他們的弟弟。 Doloonburkhan（七佛）的名字源於這個傳說，任命大熊和金棍棒Altan Hadaas，極星。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"蒙古人與大熊之間的聯繫特別令人愉快，作為這一星座的一顆星，這取決於每個蒙古人在中國曆法中的出生年份。中文和蒙古歷有一些相似之處（蒙古歷是陰曆）。每年都與動物有關，並且與大熊星座的星星有關。第一個，Dubhe（alpha UMa），對應於老鼠的年份；第二個，Merak（beta UMa），對應於牛的年份，依此類推，直到大熊尾巴的尾部，Alkaid代表馬年。 。然後，我們再次從羊年的第一顆星星開始，我們以相同的方式重複直到農曆的第十二年和最後一年，即豬年。因此，尾巴末端的兩個星星僅被分配一次。\n"
"\n"
"這是Elverskog描述的舊七佛經的一種變體。但是，那裡的恆星會上下運動，例如，Dubhe / Rat，Merak / Ox，... Mizar / Snake，Alkaid / Horse，Mizar / Goat，... Merak / Pig。\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### 流星\n"
"\n"
"流星對蒙古人也有特殊的含義：他們通過信仰被人格化。當他們看到這些流星時，他們會想像這是一顆從天上掉下來的星，它像徵著剛剛死亡的人。西方人許願，蒙古人說：““，不是我！” （這也是西撒哈拉游牧民族和一些阿拉伯部落的共同信仰）。\n"
"\n"
"#### 被忽視的傳說\n"
"\n"
"關於太陽，日食和匈奴塔凡·奧德（仙后座）的意義同樣豐富的三個傳說。但是，如今，它們被大多數蒙古人所忽略和幾乎遺忘：\n"
"\n"
"##### 太陽\n"
"\n"
">在世界的起源處，只有一個人和廣闊的特別是乾燥的草地，被七個照亮世界的太陽燒毀。這個人，一個很好的弓箭手，向眾神許諾他刺穿了所有這些太陽，甚至一次都沒有錯過任何目標。如果他失敗了，他會一拳切破自己的手指，然後像土撥鼠（土撥鼠）一樣生活在一個洞中，以避開會給他帶來沉重負擔的詛咒。他鞠躬，拉了第一個箭，擊中了目標。一秒，三分之一，直到第六個摧毀了太陽。當吞下的燕子飛過並通過它的方向時，他將第七根箭頭拉向最後的太陽而結束。那隻鳥被擊中了。這個人沒有達到他的目標，所以他離開了一個洞，被放逐，割斷了手指，變成了土撥鼠。燕子剛剛拯救了我們的太陽，否則所有生命將從世界表面消失。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"我們必須在這裡看到與數字7相似的數字，它在蒙古文化中像所有奇數一樣重要。他們為佛教帶來了運氣。\n"
"\n"
"##### 日食\n"
"\n"
">那時，有一個可怕的怪物叫拉阿（Raah），嚇壞了整個世界。他吞沒了一切。 Orchiwaani神擁有一個神奇的春天：喝了它的人就變得不朽。有一天，拉阿偷走了神奇的春天，喝醉了。月亮和太陽在表演中抓住了怪物，並向Orchiwaani匯報。聽到他要去與怪物戰鬥的這一消息，他怒不可遏。他多次砍了頭，但由於拉哈變得不朽，它又立刻長大了。然後，他打算剪掉它的尾巴，以便讓所有吃掉的東西直接再次離開。正如Orchiwaani抓住怪物將其完成時一樣，它在月球與太陽之間逃脫並消失了。然後Orchiwaani要求月亮幫助，後者重新奪回了Raah，並割下了臀部和尾巴。為了報仇，怪物有時會回來吃月球或太陽，但他們總是立即退出月球。這是月食和日食的神話原因。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"當發生日食時，蒙古人知道這意味著拉哈吞噬了月亮或太陽，並且他們發出很多噪音，以使怪物解放被日食覆蓋的怪物。在13世紀，紀堯姆·德·布魯克（Guillaume de Rubruck）寫道[#1]：\n"
"\n"
">一些“ [蒙古人]”具有天文學知識，並向“其他蒙古人”預測了月食和日食，並且在即將發生的時候，每個人都積蓄了食物，因為他們沒有通過門他們的住所。當日食發生時，他們會彈鼓和樂器，並發出很大的聲音和嘶啞聲。當月蝕結束時，他們將全神貫注於飲料和節日，並舉行大型聚會。”\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"在2008年，Eclipse旅行者仍然目睹司機和廚師躲在帳篷裡，用鍋發出聲音。看起來很真實，對遊客來說不是表演。還要注意拉赫與印度拉胡的相似之處。\n"
"\n"
"##### 仙后座（Hun Tavan Od）\n"
"\n"
"仙后座（匈奴塔凡奧德）象徵蒙古人的團結，兄弟情誼和團結。這個星座的五顆星代表成吉思汗的妻子Oulin的五個孩子的團結。\n"
"\n"
">他們彼此相處不好，一直吵架。他們的母親決定強力係好五根繩子，每根繩子都應嘗試解開結。如果他們成功了，那就意味著他們不會與其他人保持團結，兄弟會也不會在困難時期聚集。相反，如果這兩個結節經受住了考驗，那麼這五個兄弟將在以後的生活中保持團結一致，並在戰爭中取得勝利。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### 與天空相關的其他信仰\n"
"\n"
"根據蒙古的傳說，一個獻身於天空中一百顆星星的女人會夢見她未來的丈夫。\n"
"\n"
"有時，蒙古人會向牛奶熊方向投擲牛奶，以此來紀念大熊（Doloon Burkhan）。白色的牛奶象徵著蒙古的純正。他們祈禱以便有所成就，但對於幾個人，而不只是一個人，因為這會帶來厄運。牛奶可以用伏特加代替，因為伏特加無色，象徵著深色和蒙古人的力量。這樣可以避免厄運，爭吵，恐懼並抵禦邪靈。\n"
"\n"
"### 結論\n"
"\n"
"這些星座的靈感來自西方國家，但是蒙古宇宙論在此簡要介紹，突顯了與之相關的著名信仰。蒙古的文化和知識傳播基本上是口頭的，因此關於這些主題的書面痕跡很少。因此，特別難於將它們的外觀與高保真度和精度相關聯。為了保留有關此宇宙論的知識，歡迎任何觀察，建議或合作！\n"
