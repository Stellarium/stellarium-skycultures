#. Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental\n"
"civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars\n"
"considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely\n"
"influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous\n"
"myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are\n"
"the main themes of this sky culture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably\n"
"to link with the excellent observing conditions for whom they benefit even now.\n"
"In the past, the necessity for Mogolians to move and to get one's bearing even\n"
"during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements\n"
"which developed their imagination facing the sky.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is\n"
"symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms\n"
"are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the\n"
"Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called\n"
"_Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer\n"
"triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_\n"
"inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the\n"
"five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond\n"
"Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era.\n"
"\n"
"Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day\n"
"of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and\n"
"the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some\n"
"peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday),\n"
"Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_\n"
"(associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday),\n"
"Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last,\n"
"invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the\n"
"characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating\n"
"the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the\n"
"name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar\n"
"designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto'\n"
"Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the\n"
"Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus,\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun,\n"
"_Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real\n"
"equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of\n"
"the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in\n"
"India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an\n"
"unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
"It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating\n"
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, the Milky Way is named\n"
"_Tengeriin Zadas_ which could literally be translated as the Sky Line\n"
"(_Tengeriin_, the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_, the\n"
"line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above\n"
"Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was\n"
"placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an\n"
"archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to\n"
"discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
"From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to\n"
"_Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer,\n"
"mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia.\n"
"Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and\n"
"astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely\n"
"measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters\n"
"radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is\n"
"limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and\n"
"body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding\n"
"> capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it\n"
"> peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked\n"
"> the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to\n"
"> rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went\n"
"> together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched\n"
"> for the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and\n"
"> killed it. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to\n"
"> the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded\n"
"> and changed immediately into the North Star. The seven others changed into\n"
"> the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night.\n"
"> The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to\n"
"> appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian\n"
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to\n"
"every Mongolian depending on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese\n"
"and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a\n"
"lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and is associated with a\n"
"star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds\n"
"to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the\n"
"ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the\n"
"year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the\n"
"sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese\n"
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail\n"
"are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There\n"
"however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e.,\n"
"Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
"Shooting stars have also a specific meaning for Mongolians: they are\n"
"personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they\n"
"imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes\n"
"somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\n"
"\"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of\n"
"the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
"Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan\n"
"Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by\n"
"most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry\n"
"> meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good\n"
"> archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without\n"
"> missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the\n"
"> fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to\n"
"> ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first\n"
"> arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed\n"
"> the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when\n"
"> a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man\n"
"> had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers\n"
"> and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all\n"
"> life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the\n"
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist\n"
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the\n"
"> entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_\n"
"> owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_\n"
"> stole the magic spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in\n"
"> the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this\n"
"> piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it\n"
"> grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended\n"
"> to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly.\n"
"> Just as _Orchiwaani_ had seized the monster to finish it off, it escaped and\n"
"> disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to\n"
"> help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the\n"
"> monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always\n"
"> immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar\n"
"> eclipses.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the\n"
"Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to\n"
"liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote [#1]:\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to\n"
"> other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to\n"
"> produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of\n"
"> their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and\n"
"> instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they\n"
"> devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their\n"
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the\n"
"tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the\n"
"Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children\n"
"of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their\n"
"> mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a\n"
"> knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other,\n"
"> and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots\n"
"> withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the\n"
"> rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred\n"
"stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk\n"
"in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They\n"
"pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just\n"
"one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka\n"
"which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for\n"
"Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off\n"
"evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian\n"
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which\n"
"are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is\n"
"essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is\n"
"therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and\n"
"precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every\n"
"observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

msgstr ""
"Les constellations mongoles et la cosmogonie ont été héritées de la civilisation occidentale, notamment par le contact avec Alexandre le Grand dont les érudits considéraient la science astrale babylonienne comme la norme la plus élevée. Il a également été largement influencé par la civilisation chinoise et la religion bouddhiste, entraînant de nombreux mythes et croyances liés à ce qui les entoure. La faune et la flore locales sont les principaux thèmes de cette culture du ciel. La richesse de leur cosmogonie est probablement liée aux excellentes conditions d'observation dont ils bénéficient aujourd'hui. Dans le passé, la nécessité pour les Mogoliens de se déplacer et de se repérer même pendant la nuit et à différentes saisons, est probablement l'un des éléments qui ont développé leur imagination face au ciel.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Généralement, les étoiles représentent des animaux tournant autour de l'étoile polaire qui est symbolisée par le bâton d'or (_Altan Hadaas_). Presque tous les astérismes mongols sont similaires aux modernes, mais certains ont des noms différents, par exemple: le cygne est nommé _Num Sum_ (l'arc et la flèche) et la grande Ourse est appelée _Doloon Burkhan_. Dans l'imaginaire mongol, les étoiles du triangle d'été, c'est-à-dire Vega, Deneb et Altair, se réfèrent à trois cerfs (_Gurvan Maral Od_ en mongol) et Cassiopée représente la femme cinq étoiles (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planètes et étoiles\n"
"\n"
"À l'origine, l'astrologie tibéto-mongole calculait les positions de chacune des cinq planètes à l'œil nu (Mercure, Vénus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne): les planètes au-delà de Saturne n'étaient pas reconnues à l'ère pré-télescopique.\n"
"\n"
"Comme dans la culture romaine, les Mongols ont attribué les cinq planètes à chaque jour de la semaine, complétant la semaine de sept jours avec le Soleil (_Nar_) pour dimanche et la Lune (_Sar_) pour lundi. Les noms des planètes du système solaire ont quelques particularités en mongol. Mercure est nommé _Bud_ (associé à mercredi), Vénus, _Sugar_ (associé à vendredi), la Terre, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_ (associé à mardi), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associé à jeudi), Saturne, _Sanchir_ (associé à samedi) . Le terme pour Uranus est _Tengeriin-van_ et pour Neptune _Dalai-van_. On peut voir que les deux derniers, invisibles à l'œil nu, et découverts longtemps après les autres, ont les caractéristiques d'avoir la particule _-van_ à la fin du nom, indiquant le statut princier en mongol. La Terre n'a pas cette particule dans le nom mais la planète naine Pluton (_Dalkhii-van_ en mongol) a une désignation très similaire et inclut cette particule. Il est possible de traduire le nom mongol de Pluton par \"La terre princière\"; c'est quelque chose comme la terre mais pas la Terre (planète) mais le sol / surface sur lequel nous marchons. Uranus, _Tengeriin-van_, pourrait être traduit comme \"ciel princier\", et Neptun, _Dalai-van_, comme \"l'océan princier\". Néanmoins, cette particule n'a pas de véritable équivalent en anglais, et les traductions ci-dessus sont présentées pour donner une idée de la signification du nom des planètes. Ces noms viennent du sanskrit (langue parlée en Inde) et sont largement utilisés dans la langue actuelle en Mongolie mais de manière non officielle.\n"
"\n"
"Il est également très intéressant de voir le lien étroit entre les termes désignant d'autres corps célestes et leurs croyances: en effet, la Voie lactée est nommée _Tengeriin Zadas_ qui pourrait littéralement être traduite par Sky Line (_Tengeriin_, le ciel, qui signifie aussi le dieu de le ciel et _Zadas_, la ligne). Bien connu dans la tradition des étoiles mongoles, Alcor, l'étoile située au-dessus de Mizar dans la Grande Ourse. Il symbolise l'étoile de récupération et de protection. Il a été placé ici par _Tengeriin_ (dieu du ciel) pour protéger Mizar. Pour devenir archer pour Gengis Khan (XIIIe siècle), il semblait qu'il fallait pouvoir discerner ces deux étoiles à l'œil nu.\n"
"\n"
"D'un point de vue historique, cette excellente connaissance du ciel remonte à _Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ de son vrai nom), astronome, mathématicien et vice-roi à Samarkand. Son empire s'étend à l'Asie centrale. Se détournant de ses obligations royales, il a examiné les corps célestes et les questions astronomiques de son temps. Il est le premier à mesurer de façon extrêmement précise la période de révolution de Saturne (_Sanchir_) avec un sextant de 40 mètres de rayon.\n"
"\n"
"### Mythes et légendes\n"
"\n"
"#### La Grande Ourse\n"
"\n"
"Les Mongols sont particulièrement attachés à la Grande Ourse. Cette constellation est limitée pour eux aux sept étoiles de la Ourse formant la queue et le corps de l'ours, et la légende la concernant est probablement la plus célèbre de Mongolie.\n"
"\n"
"> Il était une fois, huit frères orphelins dotés de capacités exceptionnelles vivant dans un royaume. Le roi et la reine y vivaient paisiblement. Un jour, un monstre est venu et a kidnappé la reine. Le roi a demandé aux huit frères de la ramener et a dit: \"Si l'un de vous réussit à sauver ma bien-aimée, je lui donnerai une flèche d'or\". Les orphelins sont allés ensemble pour aider leur reine. Pendant deux jours et trois nuits, ils ont cherché le monstre. Puis, au milieu de la troisième nuit, ils l'ont trouvé et tué. Ils ont ramené la reine au château.\n"
"> Le roi n'a pas découpé la flèche en huit parties, il a décidé de la jeter vers le ciel. Le premier à l'attraper pourrait le garder. Le plus jeune frère a réussi et s'est immédiatement transformé en l'étoile polaire. Les sept autres se sont transformés en sept dieux, les sept bouddhas visitant leur frère cadet tous les soirs. Le nom _Doloonburkhan_ (les Sept Bouddhas) vient de cette légende pour nommer le Grand Ours et le Bâton d'Or, _Altan Hadaas_, l'Étoile Polaire.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Une tradition, particulièrement délicieuse, concerne le lien entre le peuple mongol et la Grande Ourse, car une étoile de cette constellation est attribuée à chaque mongol en fonction de son année de naissance dans le calendrier chinois. Les calendriers chinois et mongol ont quelques similitudes (le calendrier mongol est un calendrier lunaire). Chaque année est liée à un animal et est associée à une étoile de la constellation du Grand Ours. Le premier, Dubhe (alpha UMa), correspond à l'année du rat, le second, Merak (beta UMa), correspond à l'année du bœuf et ainsi de suite jusqu'à la fin de la queue de la Grande Ourse où Alkaid symbolise l'année du cheval . Puis on recommence à la première étoile de l'année du mouton et on recommence de la même manière jusqu'à la douzième et dernière année du calendrier chinois, celle du cochon. Par conséquent, les deux étoiles à la fin de la queue sont attribuées une seule fois.\n"
"\n"
"Ceci est une variante de l'ancien Sutra des Sept Bouddhas décrit par _Elverskog_. Là cependant, l'association des étoiles va dans un mouvement de haut en bas, c'est-à-dire Dubhe / Rat, Merak / Ox, ... Mizar / Snake, Alkaid / Horse, Mizar / Goat, ... Merak / Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Étoiles filantes\n"
"\n"
"Les étoiles filantes ont également une signification particulière pour les Mongols: elles sont personnifiées par leurs croyances. Quand ils voient ces étoiles filantes, ils s'imaginent que c'est une étoile qui tombe du ciel et qui symbolise quelqu'un qui vient de mourir. Alors que les occidentaux font un vœu, les Mongols disent: \"Ouf, ce n'est pas moi!\" (qui est également une croyance commune parmi les peuples nomades du Sahara occidental et certaines tribus arabes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Légendes négligées\n"
"\n"
"Trois légendes tout aussi riches de sens concernent le Soleil, les éclipses et _Hun Tavan Od_ (Cassiopée). Cependant, ils sont aujourd'hui négligés et presque oubliés par la plupart des Mongols:\n"
"\n"
"##### Soleil\n"
"\n"
"> A l'origine du monde, il n'y avait qu'un seul homme et de vastes prairies particulièrement sèches, brûlées par les sept soleils qui éclairaient le monde. Cet homme, un très bon archer, a fait la promesse aux dieux qu'il a transpercé tous ces soleils sans manquer une seule cible. S'il échouait, il se couperait tous les doigts un par un et partirait vivre dans un trou comme une marmotte (marmotte) pour conjurer la malédiction qui pèserait sur lui. Il a pris son arc, a tiré une première flèche et a atteint sa cible. Un deuxième, un troisième jusqu'au sixième qui détruisit les soleils. Il termina en tirant sa septième flèche vers le dernier soleil, lorsqu'une hirondelle s'envola et traversa sa direction. L'oiseau a été touché. L'homme n'avait pas atteint son but, alors il est parti vers l'exil dans un trou, s'est coupé les doigts et s'est transformé en marmotte. L'hirondelle venait de sauver notre Soleil, sinon toute vie aurait disparu de la surface du monde.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Nous devons voir ici un parallèle avec le nombre sept, important dans la culture mongole comme tous les nombres impairs. Ils portent chance dans la religion bouddhiste.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
"> A cette époque, vivait un monstre effrayant nommé _Raah_ qui effrayait le monde entier. Il a dévoré tout ce qui se trouvait sur son chemin. Le dieu _Orchiwaani_ possédait une source magique: celui qui en buvait devenait immortel. Un jour, _Raah_ a volé la source magique et a bu. La Lune et le Soleil ont attrapé le monstre dans l'acte et ont fait rapport à _Orchiwaani_. Bouillant de rage d'entendre parler de cette nouvelle, il est allé combattre le monstre. Il s'est coupé la tête plusieurs fois mais il a de nouveau grossi immédiatement parce que _Raah_ était devenu immortel. Ensuite, il avait l'intention de lui couper la queue afin de permettre à tout ce qu'il mangeait de repartir directement. Tout comme _Orchiwaani_ avait saisi le monstre pour l'achever, il s'est échappé et a disparu entre la Lune et le Soleil. Puis _Orchiwaani_ a demandé à la Lune de l'aider, qui a repris _Raah_ et lui a coupé la croupe et la queue. Pour se venger, le monstre revient parfois manger la Lune ou le Soleil mais ils en sortent toujours immédiatement. C'est la raison mythologique des éclipses lunaires et solaires.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Quand il y a une éclipse, les Mongols savent que cela signifie que _Raah_ dévore la Lune ou le Soleil et ils font beaucoup de bruit afin de faire libérer le monstre éclipsé par le monstre. Au XIIIe siècle, Guillaume de Rubruck écrit [#1]:\n"
"\n"
"> Certains \\[mongols\\] ont des connaissances en astronomie et les prédisent \\[à d'autres mongols\\] les éclipses lunaires et solaires et, quand il est sur le point d'en produire un, tout le monde s'approvisionne en nourriture parce qu'ils ne passent pas la porte de leur habitation. Et pendant que l'éclipse se produit, ils jouent du tambour et des instruments et font du bruit et des clameurs. Lorsque l'éclipse est terminée, ils se consacrent à la boisson et à la fête et font une grande fête. \"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Les voyageurs d'Eclipse en 2008 ont encore vu des chauffeurs et des cuisiniers se cacher dans leurs tentes et faire du bruit avec les pots. Cela semblait authentique, pas un spectacle pour les touristes. Notez également la similitude de _Raah_ avec _Rahu_ indien.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopée (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopée (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolise l'unité, la fraternité, la solidarité pour les Mongols. Les cinq étoiles de la constellation représentent l'unité des cinq enfants de la femme de Gengis Khan, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> Ils ne s'entendaient pas bien et se chamaillaient tout le temps. Leur mère a décidé de lier fermement cinq cordes, et chacune devrait essayer de dénouer un nœud. S'ils réussissaient, cela signifiait qu'ils ne restaient pas unis aux autres et que la confrérie ne se réunissait pas dans les moments difficiles. À l'inverse, si les nœuds résistaient à l'épreuve, les cinq frères resteraient unis et proches pour le reste de leur vie et seraient victorieux lors des guerres.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Autres croyances liées au ciel\n"
"\n"
"Selon une légende mongole, une femme se consacrant à compter cent étoiles dans le ciel rêvera de son futur mari.\n"
"\n"
"Parfois, les Mongols honorent la Grande Ourse (_Doloon Burkhan_) en jetant du lait dans sa direction. Le lait, de couleur blanche, symbolise la pureté en Mongolie. Ils prient pour que quelque chose se réalise, mais pour plusieurs personnes, pas pour une seule personne, car cela porterait malheur. Le lait peut être remplacé par de la vodka qui, en raison de son incolore, symbolise la couleur sombre et la force des Mongols. Ce faisant, il évite la malchance, les querelles, la peur et repousse les mauvais esprits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"Les constellations sont inspirées de celles occidentales, mais la cosmogonie mongole, brièvement exposée ici, met en évidence une identité notable de croyances qui lui sont associées. La culture mongole et la transmission des connaissances sont essentiellement verbales et il existe donc peu de traces écrites sur ces sujets. Il est donc particulièrement difficile de relier leur cosmogonie avec une grande fidélité et précision. Afin de préserver les connaissances sur cette cosmogonie, toute observation, suggestion ou collaboration est la bienvenue!\n"
