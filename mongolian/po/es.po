#. Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental\n"
"civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars\n"
"considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely\n"
"influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous\n"
"myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are\n"
"the main themes of this sky culture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably\n"
"to link with the excellent observing conditions for whom they benefit even now.\n"
"In the past, the necessity for Mogolians to move and to get one's bearing even\n"
"during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements\n"
"which developed their imagination facing the sky.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is\n"
"symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms\n"
"are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the\n"
"Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called\n"
"_Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer\n"
"triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_\n"
"inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the\n"
"five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond\n"
"Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era.\n"
"\n"
"Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day\n"
"of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and\n"
"the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some\n"
"peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday),\n"
"Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_\n"
"(associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday),\n"
"Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last,\n"
"invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the\n"
"characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating\n"
"the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the\n"
"name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar\n"
"designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto'\n"
"Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the\n"
"Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus,\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun,\n"
"_Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real\n"
"equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of\n"
"the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in\n"
"India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an\n"
"unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
"It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating\n"
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, the Milky Way is named\n"
"_Tengeriin Zadas_ which could literally be translated as the Sky Line\n"
"(_Tengeriin_, the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_, the\n"
"line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above\n"
"Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was\n"
"placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an\n"
"archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to\n"
"discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
"From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to\n"
"_Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer,\n"
"mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia.\n"
"Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and\n"
"astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely\n"
"measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters\n"
"radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is\n"
"limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and\n"
"body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding\n"
"> capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it\n"
"> peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked\n"
"> the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to\n"
"> rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went\n"
"> together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched\n"
"> for the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and\n"
"> killed it. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to\n"
"> the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded\n"
"> and changed immediately into the North Star. The seven others changed into\n"
"> the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night.\n"
"> The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to\n"
"> appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian\n"
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to\n"
"every Mongolian depending on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese\n"
"and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a\n"
"lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and is associated with a\n"
"star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds\n"
"to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the\n"
"ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the\n"
"year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the\n"
"sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese\n"
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail\n"
"are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There\n"
"however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e.,\n"
"Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
"Shooting stars have also a specific meaning for Mongolians: they are\n"
"personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they\n"
"imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes\n"
"somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\n"
"\"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of\n"
"the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
"Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan\n"
"Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by\n"
"most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry\n"
"> meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good\n"
"> archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without\n"
"> missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the\n"
"> fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to\n"
"> ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first\n"
"> arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed\n"
"> the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when\n"
"> a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man\n"
"> had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers\n"
"> and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all\n"
"> life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the\n"
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist\n"
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the\n"
"> entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_\n"
"> owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_\n"
"> stole the magic spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in\n"
"> the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this\n"
"> piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it\n"
"> grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended\n"
"> to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly.\n"
"> Just as _Orchiwaani_ had seized the monster to finish it off, it escaped and\n"
"> disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to\n"
"> help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the\n"
"> monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always\n"
"> immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar\n"
"> eclipses.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the\n"
"Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to\n"
"liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote [#1]:\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to\n"
"> other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to\n"
"> produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of\n"
"> their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and\n"
"> instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they\n"
"> devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their\n"
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the\n"
"tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the\n"
"Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children\n"
"of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their\n"
"> mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a\n"
"> knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other,\n"
"> and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots\n"
"> withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the\n"
"> rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred\n"
"stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk\n"
"in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They\n"
"pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just\n"
"one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka\n"
"which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for\n"
"Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off\n"
"evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian\n"
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which\n"
"are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is\n"
"essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is\n"
"therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and\n"
"precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every\n"
"observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

msgstr ""
"Las constelaciones mongolas y la cosmogonía fueron heredadas de la civilización occidental, especialmente por el contacto con Alejandro Magno, cuyos estudiosos consideraron la ciencia astral babilónica como el más alto nivel. También fue influenciado en gran medida por la civilización china y la religión budista, lo que resultó en numerosos mitos y creencias vinculados con lo que los rodea. La fauna y la fauna local son los temas principales de esta cultura del cielo. La riqueza de su cosmogonía probablemente se relacione con las excelentes condiciones de observación para quienes se benefician incluso ahora. En el pasado, la necesidad de que los mogolianos se muevan y se pongan de pie, incluso durante la noche y en diferentes estaciones, es probablemente uno de los elementos que desarrollaron su imaginación frente al cielo.\n"
"\n"
"### Constelaciones\n"
"\n"
"En general, las estrellas representan animales girando alrededor de la Estrella del Norte, que está simbolizada por el palo de oro (_Altan Hadaas_). Casi todos los asterismos mongoles son similares a los modernos, pero algunos de ellos tienen nombres diferentes, por ejemplo: el cisne se llama _Num Sum_ (El arco y la flecha) y el Big Dipper se llama _Doloon Burkhan_. En la imaginación de Mongolia, las estrellas del triángulo de verano, es decir, Vega, Deneb y Altair, se refieren a tres ciervos (_Gurvan Maral Od_ en Mongolia) y Cassiopeia representa a la Mujer de las Cinco Estrellas (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planetas y estrellas\n"
"\n"
"Originalmente, la astrología tibeto-mongol calculaba las posiciones de cada uno de los cinco planetas a simple vista (Mercurio, Venus, Marte, Júpiter, Saturno): los planetas más allá de Saturno no fueron reconocidos en la era pre-telescópica.\n"
"\n"
"Al igual que en la cultura romana, los mongoles atribuyeron los cinco planetas a cada día de la semana, completando la semana de siete días con el Sol (_Nar_) para el domingo y la Luna (_Sar_) para el lunes. Los nombres de los planetas del sistema solar tienen algunas peculiaridades en mongol. Mercurio se llama _Bud_ (asociado con el miércoles), Venus, _Sugar_ (asociado con el viernes), la Tierra, _Delkhii_, Marte, _Angarag_ (asociado con el martes), Júpiter, _Barhasbadi_ (asociado con el jueves), Saturno, _Sanchir_ (asociado con el sábado) . El término para Urano es _Tengeriin-van_ y para Neptuno _Dalai-van_. Podemos ver que los dos últimos, invisibles a simple vista, y descubiertos mucho tiempo después que los demás, tienen las características de tener la partícula _-van_ al final del nombre, lo que indica el estado principesco en mongol. La Tierra no tiene esta partícula en el nombre pero el planeta enano Plutón (_Dalkhii-van_ en mongol) tiene una designación muy similar e incluye esta partícula. Es posible traducir el nombre mongol de Plutón como \"La tierra principesca\"; Es algo así como la Tierra pero no la Tierra (planeta) sino el suelo / superficie sobre la que caminamos. Urano, _Tengeriin-van_, podría traducirse como \"cielo principesco\", y Neptun, _Dalai-van_, como el \"océano principesco\". Sin embargo, esta partícula no tiene un equivalente real en inglés, y las traducciones anteriores se presentan para dar una idea del significado del nombre del planeta. Estos nombres provienen del sánscrito (idioma hablado en la India) y se utilizan en gran medida en el idioma actual en Mongolia, pero de manera no oficial.\n"
"\n"
"También es muy interesante ver el estrecho vínculo entre los términos que designan otros cuerpos celestes y sus creencias: de hecho, la Vía Láctea se llama _Tengeriin Zadas_, que podría traducirse literalmente como la Línea del Cielo (_Tengeriin_, el cielo, que también significa el dios de El cielo, y Zadas, la línea). Bien conocido en la historia de las estrellas de Mongolia se refiere a Alcor, la estrella ubicada sobre Mizar en el Gran Oso. Simboliza la recuperación y la estrella de protección. Fue colocado aquí por _Tengeriin_ (dios del cielo) para proteger a Mizar. Para convertirse en arquero de Genghis Khan (siglo XIII), parecía que uno tenía que poder discernir estas dos estrellas a simple vista.\n"
"\n"
"Desde un punto de vista histórico, este excelente conocimiento del cielo se remonta a _Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Traraghay_ por su nombre real), astrónomo, matemático y vice-rey en Samarcanda. Su imperio se extendió a Asia Central. Alejándose de sus obligaciones reales, examinó los cuerpos celestes y las preguntas astronómicas de su tiempo. Es el primero en medir con extrema precisión el período de revolución de Saturno (_Sanchir_) con un sextante de 40 metros de radio.\n"
"\n"
"### Mitos y leyendas\n"
"\n"
"#### El gran oso\n"
"\n"
"Los mongoles están particularmente apegados al Gran Oso. Esta constelación está limitada para ellos a las siete estrellas del Dipper que forman la cola y el cuerpo del oso, y la leyenda sobre él es probablemente la más famosa de Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
"> Había una vez, ocho hermanos huérfanos dotados de capacidades sobresalientes que vivían dentro de un reino. El rey y la reina vivían en él pacíficamente. Un día, un monstruo vino y secuestró a la reina. El rey pidió a los ocho hermanos que la trajeran de regreso y dijo: \"Si alguno de ustedes logra rescatar a mi amado, le daré una flecha de oro\". Los huérfanos fueron juntos para ayudar a su reina. Durante dos días y tres noches buscaron al monstruo. Luego, en medio de la tercera noche, lo encontraron y lo mataron. Trajeron a la reina al castillo.\n"
"> El rey no cortó la flecha en ocho partes, decidió lanzarla al cielo. El primero en atraparlo podría quedarse con él. El hermano menor tuvo éxito y se cambió inmediatamente a la Estrella del Norte. Los otros siete se convirtieron en los siete dioses, los siete Budas visitaban a su hermano menor todas las noches. El nombre _Doloonburkhan_ (los Siete Budas) proviene de esta leyenda para designar al Gran Oso y el Palo Dorado, _Altan Hadaas_, la Estrella Polar.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Una tradición, particularmente deliciosa, se refiere al vínculo entre el pueblo mongol y el Gran Oso, ya que una estrella de esta constelación se atribuye a cada mongol dependiendo de su año de nacimiento en el calendario chino. Los calendarios chino y mongol tienen algunas similitudes (el calendario mongol es un calendario lunar). Cada año está relacionado con un animal y está asociado con una estrella de la constelación Gran Oso. El primero, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponde al año de la rata, el segundo, Merak (beta UMa), corresponde al año del buey y así sucesivamente hasta el final de la cola del Gran Oso, donde Alkaid simboliza el año del caballo. . Luego comenzamos de nuevo en la primera estrella del año de la oveja y repetimos de la misma manera hasta el duodécimo y último año del calendario chino, el del cerdo. Por lo tanto, las dos estrellas al final de la cola se asignan una sola vez.\n"
"\n"
"Esta es una variante del antiguo Sutra de los Siete Buda descrito por Elverskog. Sin embargo, la asociación de las estrellas va en un movimiento de arriba abajo, es decir, Dubhe / Rat, Merak / Ox, ... Mizar / Snake, Alkaid / Horse, Mizar / Goat, ... Merak / Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Estrellas fugaces\n"
"\n"
"Las estrellas fugaces también tienen un significado específico para los mongoles: se personifican a través de sus creencias. Cuando ven estas estrellas fugaces, imaginan que es una estrella que cae del cielo y que simboliza a alguien que acaba de morir. Mientras que los occidentales piden un deseo, los mongoles dicen: \"¡Uf, no soy yo!\" (que también es una creencia común entre los pueblos nómadas del Sáhara Occidental y algunas tribus árabes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Leyendas descuidadas\n"
"\n"
"Tres leyendas tan ricas en significado se refieren al Sol, a los eclipses y a Hun Tavan Od (Cassiopeia). Sin embargo, hoy en día son descuidados y casi olvidados por la mayoría de los mongoles:\n"
"\n"
"##### Dom\n"
"\n"
"> En el origen del mundo, solo había un hombre y vastos prados particularmente secos, quemados por los siete soles que iluminaban el mundo. Este hombre, un muy buen arquero, prometió a los dioses que atravesó todos estos soles sin perder un objetivo ni una sola vez. Si fallaba, se cortaría todos los dedos uno por uno y se iría a vivir a un agujero como una marmota (marmota) para evitar la maldición que lo pesaría. Tomó su arco, sacó una primera flecha y dio en el blanco. Un segundo, un tercero hasta el sexto que destruyó los soles. Terminó tirando su séptima flecha hacia el último sol, cuando una golondrina salió volando y pasó por su dirección. El pájaro fue golpeado. El hombre no había alcanzado su objetivo, por lo que se fue al exilio en un hoyo, se cortó los dedos y se convirtió en una marmota. La golondrina acababa de salvar nuestro Sol, de lo contrario, toda la vida habría desaparecido de la superficie del mundo.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Tenemos que ver aquí un paralelo con el número siete, importante en la cultura de Mongolia como todos los números impares. Traen suerte en la religión budista.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
"> En ese momento, vivía un monstruo aterrador llamado _Raah_ que asustó al mundo entero. Devoró todo lo que estaba en su camino. El dios _Orchiwaani_ poseía un manantial mágico: quien bebía de él se volvía inmortal. Un día, _Raah_ robó el manantial mágico y bebió. La Luna y el Sol atraparon al monstruo en el acto e informaron a Orchiwaani. Rebosante de ira al enterarse de esta noticia, fue a luchar contra el monstruo. Se cortó la cabeza muchas veces, pero volvió a crecer de inmediato porque _Raah_ se había vuelto inmortal. Luego, tuvo la intención de cortarle la cola para permitir que todo lo que comía saliera nuevamente directamente. Justo cuando Orchiwaani había agarrado al monstruo para terminarlo, escapó y desapareció entre la Luna y el Sol. Luego, Orchiwaani le pidió ayuda a la Luna, quien recapturó a Raah y le cortó la grupa y la cola. En venganza, el monstruo regresa a veces para comer la Luna o el Sol, pero siempre salen inmediatamente. Esta es la razón mitológica de los eclipses lunares y solares.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Cuando hay un eclipse, los mongoles saben que significa que _Raah_ devora la Luna o el Sol y hacen mucho ruido para hacer que el monstruo libere al eclipsado. En el siglo XIII, Guillaume de Rubruck escribió [#1]:\n"
"\n"
"> Algunos \\[los mongoles\\] tienen conocimientos de astronomía y los predicen \\[a otros mongoles\\] los eclipses lunares y solares y, cuando está a punto de producir uno, todos se abastecen de alimentos porque no pasan la puerta de su habitación. Y mientras ocurre el eclipse, tocan el tambor y los instrumentos y hacen mucho ruido y clamores. Cuando termina el eclipse, se dedican a la bebida y la fiesta y hacen una gran fiesta \".\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Los viajeros de Eclipse en 2008 todavía presenciaron conductores y cocineros escondidos en sus tiendas y haciendo ruido con las ollas. Parecía auténtico, no un espectáculo para los turistas. También tenga en cuenta la similitud de _Raah_ con India _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) simboliza la unidad, la hermandad, la solidaridad para los mongoles. Las cinco estrellas de la constelación representan la unidad de los cinco hijos de la esposa de Genghis Khan, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> No se llevaban bien entre ellos y se peleaban todo el tiempo. Su madre decidió atar fuertemente cinco cuerdas, y cada una debería tratar de desatar un nudo. Si tenían éxito, significaba que no permanecían unidos con otros, y que la hermandad no se reunía en tiempos difíciles. Por el contrario, si los nudos resistieran la prueba, los cinco hermanos permanecerían unidos y unidos por el resto de sus vidas y serían victoriosos en el momento de las guerras.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Otras creencias vinculadas al cielo\n"
"\n"
"Según una leyenda mongol, una mujer que se dedique a contar cien estrellas en el cielo soñará con su futuro esposo.\n"
"\n"
"A veces, los mongoles honran al Gran Oso (_Doloon Burkhan_) arrojando leche en su dirección. La leche, de color blanco, simboliza la pureza en Mongolia. Rezan para que se pueda cumplir algo, pero para varias personas, no para una sola persona, porque esto traería mala suerte. La leche puede ser reemplazada por vodka que, debido a su falta de color, simboliza el color oscuro y la fuerza para los mongoles. Al hacer esto, evita la mala suerte, las peleas, el miedo y rechaza los espíritus malignos.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusión\n"
"\n"
"Las constelaciones están inspiradas en las occidentales, pero la cosmogonía mongol, brevemente expuesta aquí, resalta una notable identidad de creencias asociadas con ella. La transmisión de la cultura y el conocimiento de Mongolia es esencialmente verbal, y existen muy pocos rastros escritos sobre estos temas. Por lo tanto, es particularmente difícil relacionar su cosmogonía con alta fidelidad y precisión. ¡Para preservar el conocimiento sobre esta cosmogonía, todas las observaciones, sugerencias o colaboraciones son bienvenidas!\n"
