#. Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental\n"
"civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars\n"
"considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely\n"
"influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous\n"
"myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are\n"
"the main themes of this sky culture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably\n"
"to link with the excellent observing conditions for whom they benefit even now.\n"
"In the past, the necessity for Mogolians to move and to get one's bearing even\n"
"during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements\n"
"which developed their imagination facing the sky.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is\n"
"symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms\n"
"are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the\n"
"Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called\n"
"_Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer\n"
"triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_\n"
"inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the\n"
"five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond\n"
"Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era.\n"
"\n"
"Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day\n"
"of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and\n"
"the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some\n"
"peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday),\n"
"Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_\n"
"(associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday),\n"
"Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last,\n"
"invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the\n"
"characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating\n"
"the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the\n"
"name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar\n"
"designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto'\n"
"Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the\n"
"Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus,\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun,\n"
"_Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real\n"
"equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of\n"
"the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in\n"
"India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an\n"
"unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
"It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating\n"
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, the Milky Way is named\n"
"_Tengeriin Zadas_ which could literally be translated as the Sky Line\n"
"(_Tengeriin_, the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_, the\n"
"line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above\n"
"Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was\n"
"placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an\n"
"archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to\n"
"discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
"From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to\n"
"_Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer,\n"
"mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia.\n"
"Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and\n"
"astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely\n"
"measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters\n"
"radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is\n"
"limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and\n"
"body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding\n"
"> capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it\n"
"> peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked\n"
"> the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to\n"
"> rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went\n"
"> together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched\n"
"> for the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and\n"
"> killed it. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to\n"
"> the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded\n"
"> and changed immediately into the North Star. The seven others changed into\n"
"> the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night.\n"
"> The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to\n"
"> appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian\n"
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to\n"
"every Mongolian depending on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese\n"
"and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a\n"
"lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and is associated with a\n"
"star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds\n"
"to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the\n"
"ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the\n"
"year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the\n"
"sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese\n"
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail\n"
"are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There\n"
"however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e.,\n"
"Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
"Shooting stars have also a specific meaning for Mongolians: they are\n"
"personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they\n"
"imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes\n"
"somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\n"
"\"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of\n"
"the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
"Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan\n"
"Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by\n"
"most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry\n"
"> meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good\n"
"> archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without\n"
"> missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the\n"
"> fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to\n"
"> ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first\n"
"> arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed\n"
"> the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when\n"
"> a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man\n"
"> had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers\n"
"> and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all\n"
"> life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the\n"
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist\n"
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the\n"
"> entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_\n"
"> owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_\n"
"> stole the magic spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in\n"
"> the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this\n"
"> piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it\n"
"> grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended\n"
"> to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly.\n"
"> Just as _Orchiwaani_ had seized the monster to finish it off, it escaped and\n"
"> disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to\n"
"> help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the\n"
"> monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always\n"
"> immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar\n"
"> eclipses.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the\n"
"Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to\n"
"liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote [#1]:\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to\n"
"> other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to\n"
"> produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of\n"
"> their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and\n"
"> instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they\n"
"> devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their\n"
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the\n"
"tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the\n"
"Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children\n"
"of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their\n"
"> mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a\n"
"> knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other,\n"
"> and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots\n"
"> withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the\n"
"> rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred\n"
"stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk\n"
"in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They\n"
"pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just\n"
"one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka\n"
"which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for\n"
"Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off\n"
"evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian\n"
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which\n"
"are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is\n"
"essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is\n"
"therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and\n"
"precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every\n"
"observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

msgstr ""
"Costellazioni mongole e cosmogonia furono ereditate dalla civiltà occidentale, in particolare dal contatto con Alessandro Magno, i cui studiosi consideravano la scienza astrale babilonese il più alto livello. Fu anche ampiamente influenzato dalla civiltà cinese e dalla religione buddista, risultando in numerosi miti e credenze legate a ciò che li circonda. Il selvaggio locale e la fauna sono i temi principali di questa cultura del cielo. La ricchezza della loro cosmogonia è probabilmente legata alle eccellenti condizioni di osservazione di cui beneficiano anche adesso. In passato, la necessità per i mogoliani di muoversi e di farsi strada anche di notte e in diverse stagioni, è probabilmente uno degli elementi che hanno sviluppato la loro immaginazione di fronte al cielo.\n"
"\n"
"Costellazioni\n"
"\n"
"Generalmente, le stelle rappresentano animali che ruotano attorno alla stella polare che è simboleggiata dal bastone d'oro (_Altan Hadaas_). Quasi tutti gli asterismi mongoli sono simili a quelli moderni, ma alcuni di essi hanno nomi diversi, ad esempio: il cigno si chiama _Num Sum_ (L'arco e la freccia) e il Big Dipper si chiama _Doloon Burkhan_. Nell'immaginazione mongola, le stelle del triangolo estivo, ovvero Vega, Deneb e Altair, fanno riferimento a tre cervi (_Gurvan Maral Od_ in mongolo) e Cassiopea rappresenta la donna delle cinque stelle (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Pianeti e stelle\n"
"\n"
"In origine, l'astrologia tibeto-mongola calcolava le posizioni di ciascuno dei cinque pianeti ad occhio nudo (Mercurio, Venere, Marte, Giove, Saturno): i pianeti oltre Saturno non erano riconosciuti nell'era pre-telescopica.\n"
"\n"
"Come nella cultura romana, i mongoli attribuivano i cinque pianeti a ogni giorno della settimana, completando la settimana di sette giorni con il sole (_Nar_) per domenica e la luna (_Sar_) per lunedì. I nomi dei pianeti del sistema solare hanno alcune peculiarità in mongolo. Mercurio è chiamato _Bud_ (associato a mercoledì), Venere, _Sugar_ (associato a venerdì), Terra, _Delkhii_, Marte, _Angarag_ (associato a martedì), Giove, _Barhasbadi_ (associato a giovedì), Saturno, _Sanchir_ (associato a sabato) . Il termine per Urano è _Tengeriin-van_ e per Nettuno _Dalai-van_. Possiamo vedere che i due ultimi, invisibili a occhio nudo e scoperti molto tempo dopo gli altri, hanno le caratteristiche per avere la particella _-van_ alla fine del nome, indicando lo stato principesco in mongolo. La Terra non ha questa particella nel nome ma il pianeta nano Plutone (_Dalkhii-van_ in mongolo) ha una designazione molto simile e include questa particella. È possibile tradurre il nome mongolo di Plutone come \"La terra principesca\"; è qualcosa come la terra ma non la Terra (pianeta) ma il terreno / superficie su cui camminiamo. Urano, _Tengeriin-van_, potrebbe essere tradotto come \"cielo principesco\", e Nettuno, _Dalai-van_, come \"oceano principesco\". Tuttavia, questa particella non ha un vero equivalente in inglese, e le traduzioni sopra sono presentate per dare un'idea del significato del nome dei pianeti. Questi nomi provengono dal sanscrito (lingua parlata in India) e sono ampiamente utilizzati nella lingua corrente in Mongolia, ma in modo non ufficiale.\n"
"\n"
"È anche molto interessante vedere lo stretto legame tra i termini che designano altri corpi celesti e le loro credenze: in effetti, la Via Lattea è chiamata _Tengeriin Zadas_ che potrebbe letteralmente essere tradotta come Sky Line (_Tengeriin_, il cielo, che significa anche il dio di il cielo e _Zadas_, la linea). Ben noto nella tradizione mongola delle stelle riguarda Alcor, la stella situata sopra Mizar nell'Orso Maggiore. Simboleggia la stella di recupero e protezione. Fu collocato qui da _Tengeriin_ (dio del cielo) per proteggere Mizar. Per diventare un arciere di Genghis Khan (13 ° secolo), sembrava che si potesse essere in grado di discernere queste due stelle ad occhio nudo.\n"
"\n"
"Da un punto di vista storico, questa eccellente conoscenza del cielo risale a _Ulug Beg_ (1394-1449 d.C.; Taraghay_ con il suo vero nome), astronomo, matematico e vice-re di Samarcanda. Il suo impero si estese all'Asia centrale. Allontanandosi dai suoi obblighi reali, esaminò i corpi celesti e le domande astronomiche del suo tempo. È il primo a misurare con estrema precisione il periodo di rivoluzione di Saturno (_Sanchir_) con un sestante di 40 metri di raggio.\n"
"\n"
"### Miti e leggende\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"I mongoli sono particolarmente attaccati all'orso grande. Questa costellazione è limitata per loro alle sette stelle del Merlo acquaiolo che formano la coda e il corpo dell'orso, e la leggenda che lo riguarda è probabilmente la più famosa in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
"> C'erano una volta otto fratelli orfani dotati di eccezionali capacità che vivevano in un regno. Il re e la regina vivevano al suo interno pacificamente. Un giorno arrivò un mostro e rapì la regina. Il re chiese agli otto fratelli di riportarla indietro e disse: \"Se uno di voi riuscirà a salvare la mia amata, gli darò una freccia d'oro\". Gli orfani andarono insieme per assistere la loro regina. Per due giorni e tre notti hanno cercato il mostro. Poi, nel mezzo della terza notte, l'hanno trovato e ucciso. Hanno riportato la regina nel castello.\n"
"> Il re non tagliò la freccia in otto parti, decise di gettarla in cielo. Il primo a prenderlo potrebbe tenerlo. Il fratello più giovane riuscì e si trasformò immediatamente nella stella polare. Gli altri sette si trasformarono in sette dei, i sette Buddha visitavano il loro fratello minore ogni notte. Il nome _Doloonburkhan_ (i sette Buddha) deriva da questa leggenda per nominare l'orso grande e il bastone d'oro, _Altan Hadaas_, la stella polare.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Una tradizione, particolarmente deliziosa, riguarda il legame tra il popolo mongolo e l'orso maggiore in quanto una stella di questa costellazione è attribuita a ogni mongolo a seconda del suo anno di nascita nel calendario cinese. I calendari cinese e mongolo hanno alcune somiglianze (il calendario mongolo è un calendario lunare). Ogni anno è legato a un animale ed è associato a una stella della costellazione dell'Orso maggiore. Il primo, Dubhe (alfa UMa), corrisponde all'anno del ratto, il secondo, Merak (beta UMa), corrisponde all'anno del bue e così via fino alla fine della coda dell'orso grande dove Alkaid simboleggia l'anno del cavallo . Quindi ricominciamo dalla prima stella dell'anno delle pecore e ripetiamo allo stesso modo fino al dodicesimo e ultimo anno del calendario cinese, quello del maiale. Pertanto, le due stelle alla fine della coda vengono assegnate una sola volta.\n"
"\n"
"Questa è una variante del vecchio Sutra dei sette Buddha descritto da _Elverskog_. Lì, tuttavia, l'associazione delle stelle si muove su e giù, cioè Dubhe / Ratto, Merak / Bue, ... Mizar / Serpente, Alkaid / Cavallo, Mizar / Capra, ... Merak / Maiale.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Stelle cadenti\n"
"\n"
"Le stelle cadenti hanno anche un significato specifico per i mongoli: sono personificati attraverso le loro credenze. Quando vedono queste stelle cadenti immaginano che sia una stella che cade dal cielo e che simboleggia qualcuno che è appena morto. Mentre gli occidentali esprimono un desiderio, i mongoli dicono: \"Accidenti, non sono io!\" (che è anche una credenza comune tra i nomadi del Sahara occidentale e alcune tribù arabe).\n"
"\n"
"#### Legends trascurati\n"
"\n"
"Tre leggende altrettanto ricche di significato riguardano il Sole, le eclissi e _Hun Tavan Od_ (Cassiopea). Tuttavia, oggi sono trascurati e quasi dimenticati dalla maggior parte dei mongoli:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
"> All'origine del mondo, c'era un solo uomo e vasti prati particolarmente aridi, bruciati dai sette soli che illuminavano il mondo. Quest'uomo, un ottimo arciere, fece la promessa agli dei di aver trafitto tutti questi soli senza perdere nemmeno un bersaglio. Se avesse fallito, si sarebbe tagliato tutte le dita una ad una e avrebbe lasciato vivere in una buca come una marmotta (marmotta) per scongiurare la maledizione che gli avrebbe pesato. Prese l'arco, tirò una prima freccia e colpì il bersaglio. Un secondo, un terzo fino al sesto che ha distrutto i soli. Finì tirando la sua settima freccia verso l'ultimo sole, quando una rondine volò via e attraversò la sua direzione. L'uccello è stato colpito. L'uomo non aveva raggiunto il suo obiettivo, quindi è partito per l'esilio in una buca, si è tagliato le dita e si è trasformato in una marmotta. La rondine aveva appena salvato il nostro Sole, altrimenti tutta la vita sarebbe scomparsa dalla superficie del mondo.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Dobbiamo vedere qui un parallelo con il numero sette, importante nella cultura mongola come tutti i numeri dispari. Portano fortuna nella religione buddista.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclissi\n"
"\n"
"> A quel tempo viveva un mostro spaventoso di nome _Raah_ che spaventava il mondo intero. Ha divorato tutto ciò che era sulla sua strada. Il dio Orchiwaani possedeva una fonte magica: chiunque ne bevesse divenne immortale. Un giorno, Raah, rubò la primavera magica e bevve. La Luna e il Sole hanno catturato il mostro nell'atto e riferito a _Orchiwaani_. Ribollendo di rabbia per sapere di questa notizia, andò a combattere contro il mostro. Ha tagliato la testa molte volte ma è ricresciuto immediatamente perché _Raah_ era diventato immortale. Quindi, intendeva tagliargli la coda per permettere a tutto ciò che mangiava di ripartire direttamente. Proprio come Orchiwaani aveva preso il mostro per finirlo, è fuggito e è scomparso tra la Luna e il Sole. Quindi _Orchiwaani_ chiese alla Luna di aiutare, che ricatturò _Raah_ e tagliò la sua groppa e la sua coda. Per vendetta, il mostro torna a volte a mangiare la Luna o il Sole, ma escono sempre immediatamente. Questa è la ragione mitologica delle eclissi lunari e solari.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Quando c'è un'eclissi, i mongoli sanno che vuol dire che _Raah_ divora la Luna o il Sole e fanno molto rumore per fare in modo che il mostro liberi quello eclissato. Nel 13 ° secolo, Guillaume de Rubruck scrisse [#1]:\n"
"\n"
"> Alcuni \\[popolo mongolo\\] hanno conoscenze in astronomia e li predicono \\[agli altri mongoli\\] le eclissi lunari e solari e, quando sta per produrne uno, tutti fanno scorta di cibo perché non varcano la porta della loro abitazione. E mentre succede l'eclissi, suonano il tamburo e gli strumenti e fanno rumore e clamori. Quando l'eclissi è terminata, si dedicano alle bevande e alle feste e organizzano una grande festa. \"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"I viaggiatori di Eclipse nel 2008 hanno ancora assistito a conducenti e cuochi che si nascondevano nelle loro tende e facevano rumore con le pentole. Sembrava autentico, non uno spettacolo per i turisti. Nota anche la somiglianza di _Raah_ con l'indiano _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopea (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopea (_Hun Tavan Od_) simboleggia unità, fratellanza, solidarietà per i mongoli. Le cinque stelle della costellazione rappresentano l'unità dei cinque figli della moglie di Gengis Khan, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> Non andarono molto d'accordo l'uno con l'altro e litigarono continuamente. La loro madre ha deciso di legare fortemente cinque corde e ognuna dovrebbe cercare di sciogliere un nodo. Se ci riuscivano, significava che non rimanevano uniti agli altri e che la fratellanza non si riuniva in tempi difficili. Al contrario, se i nodi resistessero alla prova, i cinque fratelli rimarrebbero uniti e chiusi per il resto della loro vita e sarebbero vittoriosi al tempo delle guerre.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Altre credenze legate al cielo\n"
"\n"
"Secondo una leggenda mongola, una donna che si dedica a contare cento stelle nel cielo sognerà il suo futuro marito.\n"
"\n"
"A volte, i mongoli onorano l'orso grande (_Doloon Burkhan_) lanciando il latte nella sua direzione. Il latte, di colore bianco, simboleggia la purezza in Mongolia. Pregano affinché qualcosa possa essere realizzato, ma per diverse persone, non solo per una persona, perché ciò porterebbe sfortuna. Il latte può essere sostituito dalla vodka che, per la sua incolore, simboleggia il colore scuro e la forza dei mongoli. In questo modo, evita la sfortuna, i litigi, la paura e respinge gli spiriti maligni.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusione\n"
"\n"
"Le costellazioni sono ispirate da quelle occidentali, ma la cosmogonia mongola, qui brevemente esposta, evidenzia una notevole identità di credenze ad essa associate. La cultura mongola e la trasmissione della conoscenza sono essenzialmente verbali e quindi esistono poche tracce scritte su questi argomenti. È quindi particolarmente difficile mettere in relazione la loro cosmogonia con alta fedeltà e precisione. Al fine di preservare la conoscenza di questa cosmogonia, ogni osservazione, suggerimento o collaborazione sono i benvenuti!\n"
