# Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are the main themes of this skyculture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably to link with the observation conditions for whom they benefit even now. In the past, the necessity for them to move and to get one's bearing even during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements which developed their imagination facing the sky. \n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
" Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called _Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_ inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
" Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era. \n"
"\n"
" Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday), Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_ (associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday), Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is _Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last, invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto' Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus, _Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun, _Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an unofficial way. \n"
"\n"
" It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, _Tengeriin Zadas_ appoints the Milky Way. We could literally translate this as the \"Sky Line\" (_Tengeriin_ for the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_ for the line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
" From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to _Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer, mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia. Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters radius. \n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
" Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia. \n"
"\n"
">  \n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and killed the monster. They brought back the queen in the castle. \n"
"> \n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded and changed immediately into the North Star (Polar Star). The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night. The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
" A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and each of them is associated with a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail are assigned one time only. \n"
"\n"
"\\[Note by G. Zotti: This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e., Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\\]\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
" Shooting stars have also a specific meaning: they are personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say: \"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes). \n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
" Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by most Mongolians: \n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">  \n"
">  At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
" We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">   \n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_ owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_ stole the spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly. Just as _Orchiwaani_ would seize the monster to finish it off, it escaped and disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar eclipses.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote:\n"
"\n"
">  \n"
"> \"Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
"(Source: [#1])\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin. \n"
"\n"
">  \n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other, and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
"> \n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
" Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
" The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"
