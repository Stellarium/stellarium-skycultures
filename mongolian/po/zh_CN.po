"Mongolian constellations and cosmogony were inherited from the occidental\n"
"civilisation notably by the contact with Alexander the Great whose scholars\n"
"considered Babylonian astral science as highest standard. It was also largely\n"
"influenced by Chinese civilisation and Buddhist religion, resulting in numerous\n"
"myths and beliefs linked with what surrounds them. The local wild and fauna are\n"
"the main themes of this sky culture. The wealth of their cosmogony is probably\n"
"to link with the excellent observing conditions for whom they benefit even now.\n"
"In the past, the necessity for Mogolians to move and to get one's bearing even\n"
"during the night and at different seasons, is probably one of the elements\n"
"which developed their imagination facing the sky.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is\n"
"symbolized by the golden stick (_Altan Hadaas_). Almost all Mongolian asterisms\n"
"are similar to the modern ones but some of them have different names, e.g.: the\n"
"Swan is named _Num Sum_ (The Bow and the Arrow) and the Big Dipper is called\n"
"_Doloon Burkhan_. In the Mongolian imagination, the stars of the summer\n"
"triangle, i.e. Vega, Deneb and Altair, refer to three stags (_Gurvan Maral Od_\n"
"inMongolian) and Cassiopeia represents the Five Stars Woman (_Hun Tavan Od_).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculated the positions of each of the\n"
"five naked eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn): planets beyond\n"
"Saturn were not recognized in the pre-telescopic era.\n"
"\n"
"Like in Roman culture, the Mongolians attributed the five planets to each day\n"
"of the week, completing the seven days week with the Sun (_Nar_) for Sunday and\n"
"the Moon(_Sar_) for Monday. The names of the solar system's planets have some\n"
"peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named _Bud_ (associated with Wednesday),\n"
"Venus, _Sugar_ (associated with Friday), the Earth, _Delkhii_, Mars, _Angarag_\n"
"(associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, _Barhasbadi_ (associated with Thursday),\n"
"Saturn, _Sanchir_ (associated with Saturday). The term for Uranus is\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_ and for Neptune _Dalai-van_. We can see that the two last,\n"
"invisible to the naked eye, and discovered long time after the others, have the\n"
"characteristics to have the particle _-van_ at the end of the name, indicating\n"
"the princely status in Mongolian. The Earth does not have this particle in the\n"
"name but dwarf planet Pluto (_Dalkhii-van_ in Mongolian) has a very similiar\n"
"designation and includes this particle. It is possible to translate Pluto'\n"
"Mongolian name as \"The princely ground\"; it is something like earth but not the\n"
"Earth (planet) but the ground/ surface on which we walk. Uranus,\n"
"_Tengeriin-van_, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptun,\n"
"_Dalai-van_, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real\n"
"equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of\n"
"the planets name's meaning. These names come from Sanskrit (language spoken in\n"
"India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an\n"
"unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
"It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating\n"
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: Indeed, the Milky Way is named\n"
"_Tengeriin Zadas_ which could literally be translated as the Sky Line\n"
"(_Tengeriin_, the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and _Zadas_, the\n"
"line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above\n"
"Mizar in the Great Bear. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. It was\n"
"placed here by _Tengeriin_ (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an\n"
"archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to\n"
"discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
"From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to\n"
"_Ulug Beg_ (AD 1394-1449; _Taraghay_ by his real name), astronomer,\n"
"mathematician and vice-king in Samarkand. His empire extended to Central Asia.\n"
"Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and\n"
"astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely\n"
"measure Saturn's revolution period (_Sanchir_) with a sextant of 40 meters\n"
"radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"#### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
"Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is\n"
"limited for them to the seven stars of the Dipper forming the bear's tail and\n"
"body, and the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding\n"
"> capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it\n"
"> peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked\n"
"> the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to\n"
"> rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went\n"
"> together to assist their queen. For two days and three nights they searched\n"
"> for the monster. Then, in the middle of the third night, they found and\n"
"> killed it. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it to\n"
"> the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The youngest brother succeeded\n"
"> and changed immediately into the North Star. The seven others changed into\n"
"> the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night.\n"
"> The name _Doloonburkhan_ (the Seven Buddhas) comes from this legend to\n"
"> appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, _Altan Hadaas_, the Polar Star.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian\n"
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to\n"
"every Mongolian depending on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese\n"
"and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a\n"
"lunar calendar). Each year is related to an animal and is associated with a\n"
"star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe (alpha UMa), corresponds\n"
"to the rat's year, the second, Merak (beta UMa), corresponds to the year of the\n"
"ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the\n"
"year of the horse. Then we start again at the first star in the year of the\n"
"sheep and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and last year of the Chinese\n"
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail\n"
"are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by _Elverskog_. There\n"
"however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e.,\n"
"Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox,... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
"Shooting stars have also a specific meaning for Mongolians: they are\n"
"personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they\n"
"imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes\n"
"somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say:\n"
"\"Phew, it is not me!\" (which is also a common belief among nomadic people of\n"
"the West Sahara and some Arabic tribes).\n"
"\n"
"#### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
"Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and _Hun Tavan\n"
"Od_ (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by\n"
"most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"##### Sun\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry\n"
"> meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good\n"
"> archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without\n"
"> missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the\n"
"> fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to\n"
"> ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first\n"
"> arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed\n"
"> the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when\n"
"> a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man\n"
"> had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers\n"
"> and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all\n"
"> life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the\n"
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist\n"
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"##### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> At that time, there lived a scary monster named _Raah_ which frightened the\n"
"> entire world. He devoured all what were in its way. The god _Orchiwaani_\n"
"> owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, _Raah_\n"
"> stole the magic spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in\n"
"> the act and reported to _Orchiwaani_. Seething with rage to hear about this\n"
"> piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it\n"
"> grew again immediately because _Raah_ had become immortal. Then, he intended\n"
"> to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly.\n"
"> Just as _Orchiwaani_ had seized the monster to finish it off, it escaped and\n"
"> disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then _Orchiwaani_ asked the Moon to\n"
"> help, who recaptured _Raah_ and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the\n"
"> monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun but they always\n"
"> immediately exit it. This is the mythological reason for lunar and solar\n"
"> eclipses.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that _Raah_ devours the\n"
"Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise in order to make the monster to\n"
"liberate the eclipsed one. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote [#1]:\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Some \\[Mongolian people\\] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them \\[to\n"
"> other Mongolian people\\] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to\n"
"> produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of\n"
"> their habitation. And while the eclipse happens, they play the drum and\n"
"> instruments and make big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they\n"
"> devote themselves to beverage and festivity and make a big party.\"\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their\n"
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the\n"
"tourists. Also note the similarity of _Raah_ with Indian _Rahu_.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (_Hun Tavan Od_) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the\n"
"Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children\n"
"of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
">\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their\n"
"> mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a\n"
"> knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with other,\n"
"> and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots\n"
"> withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the\n"
"> rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred\n"
"stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (_Doloon Burkhan_) by throwing milk\n"
"in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They\n"
"pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just\n"
"one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka\n"
"which, due to its colorlessness, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for\n"
"Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off\n"
"evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian\n"
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which\n"
"are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is\n"
"essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is\n"
"therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and\n"
"precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every\n"
"observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

msgstr ""
"蒙古星座和宇宙论是从西方文明继承而来的，尤其是与亚历山大大帝的接触，亚历山大大帝的学者认为巴比伦的星体科学是最高标准。它在很大程度上也受到了中华文明和佛教宗教的影响，从而产生了许多与周围环境有关的神话和信仰。当地的野生动植物是这种天空文化的主题。他们具有丰富的宇宙色彩，可能与他们即使现在仍然受益的优良观测条件有关。过去，即使在夜晚和不同季节，蒙古人也必须移动并承受压力，这可能是他们面对天空发展想象力的因素之一。\n"
"\n"
"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"通常，星星代表围绕北极星旋转的动物，北极星由金色棍子（Altan Hadaas）象征。几乎所有蒙古星号都与现代星号相似，但其中一些有着不同的名称，例如：天鹅被称为Num Sum（弓箭），而北斗七星则被称为Doloon Burkhan。在蒙古人的想象中，夏季三角形的星星（即Vega，Deneb和Altair）指的是三个鹿角（蒙古人的Gurvan Maral Od），仙后座则代表五颗星星的女人（Hun Tavan Od）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星和恒星\n"
"\n"
"最初，西藏-蒙古占星术计算五个肉眼行星（水星，金星，火星，木星，土星）中每个行星的位置：在遥远的卫星时代，土星以外的行星未被识别。\n"
"\n"
"与罗马文化一样，蒙古人将这五颗行星归因于一周中的每一天，以星期日（Nar）为星期日和月亮（Sar）为一周完成了为期七天的工作。太阳系行星的名称在蒙古语中有一些特殊之处。水星被命名为芽（与周三相关），金星，糖（与周五相关），地球，德尔基，火星，安加拉格（与周二相关），木星，巴尔哈斯巴迪（与周四相关），土星，桑契尔（与周六相关） 。天王星的术语是Tengeriin-van，海王星Dalai-van。我们可以看到，肉眼看不见的最后两个，在很长一段时间后才被发现，它们的特征是名称末尾带有粒子-van，表明蒙古语中的王子身份。地球名称上没有这个粒子，但是矮行星冥王星（蒙古语中的Dalkhii-van）具有非常相似的名称，并且包括这个粒子。冥王星的蒙古语名字可能被翻译成“王子的土地”。它就像地球，但不是地球（行星），而是我们行走的地面/表面。 Tengeriin-van的天王星可以被翻译成“王子的天空”，而Dalai-van的Neptun可以被翻译成“王子的海洋”。尽管如此，这个粒子在英语中并没有真正的等价物，并且上面的翻译给出了行星名称含义的含义。这些名称来自梵语（印度使用的语言），并在蒙古语中以目前的语言广泛使用，但以非官方的方式使用。\n"
"\n"
"看到指定其他天体的术语与它们的信仰之间的紧密联系也很有趣：的确，银河系被命名为Tengeriin Zadas，从字面上可以翻译为“天际线”（Tengeriin，天空，也意为天神）。天空，以及Zadas，直线）。蒙古巨星传说中最著名的是阿尔科（Alcor），那颗巨熊位于米萨尔（Mizar）的上方。它象征着恢复与保护之星。它是由Tengeriin（天堂之神）放置在这里的，以保护Mizar。要成为成吉思汗（13世纪）的弓箭手，似乎必须能够用肉眼辨认这两颗星星。\n"
"\n"
"从历史的角度来看，对天空的出色了解可以追溯到乌鲁格·贝格（Ulug Beg，公元1394-1449；他的真名Taraghay），撒马尔罕的天文学家，数学家和副国王。他的帝国扩展到中亚。他放弃了王室职责，研究了当时的天体和天文问题。他是第一个以半径40米的六分仪极其精确地测量土星的革命时期（Sanchir）的人。\n"
"\n"
"### 神话传说\n"
"\n"
"#### 大熊\n"
"\n"
"蒙古人特别喜欢大熊熊。对于他们来说，这个星座仅限于七星组成熊的尾巴和身体的七星，关于它的传说可能是蒙古最著名的。\n"
"\n"
">曾几何时，一个王国中生活着八位天赋卓越的孤儿兄弟。国王和王后和平地生活在其中。一天，一个怪物来绑架了女王。国王请八兄弟把她带回来，并说：“如果你们中的一个人成功营救了我所爱的人，我会给他一个金色的箭”。孤儿们一起去协助女王。他们花了两天三夜寻找怪物。然后，在第三天深夜，他们发现并杀死了它。他们把女王带回了城堡。\n"
">国王没有将箭切成八部分，他决定将箭扔向天空。第一个抓住它的人可以保留它。最小的兄弟成功了，并立即变成了北极星。其他七个人变成了七个神，七个佛陀每晚都拜访他们的弟弟。 Doloonburkhan（七佛）这个名字源于这个传说，任命大熊和金棍棒，Altan Hadaas，极星。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"蒙古人与大熊之间的联系特别令人愉快，作为这一星座的一颗星，这取决于每个蒙古人在中国历法中的出生年份。中文和蒙古历有一些相似之处（蒙古历是阴历）。每年都与动物有关，并且与大熊星座的星星有关。第一个，Dubhe（alpha UMa），对应于老鼠的年份；第二个，Merak（beta UMa），对应于牛的年份，依此类推，直到大熊的尾巴的末端，其中，Alkaid象征着马的年份。 。然后，我们再次从羊年的第一颗星星开始，我们以相同的方式重复直到农历的第十二年和最后一年，即猪年。因此，尾巴末端的两个星星仅被分配一次。\n"
"\n"
"这是Elverskog描述的旧七佛经的一种变体。但是，那里的恒星会上下运动，例如，Dubhe / Rat，Merak / Ox，... Mizar / Snake，Alkaid / Horse，Mizar / Goat，... Merak / Pig。\n"
"\n"
"![](doloon_burkhan.webp)\n"
"\n"
"#### 流星\n"
"\n"
"流星对蒙古人也有特殊的含义：他们通过信仰被人格化。当他们看到这些流星时，他们会想象这是一颗从天上掉下来的星，它象征着刚刚死亡的人。西方人许愿，蒙古人说：““，不是我！” （这也是西撒哈拉游牧民族和一些阿拉伯部落的共同信仰）。\n"
"\n"
"#### 被忽视的传说\n"
"\n"
"关于太阳，日食和匈奴塔凡·奥德（仙后座）的意义同样丰富的三个传说。但是，如今，它们被大多数蒙古人所忽略和几乎遗忘：\n"
"\n"
"##### 太阳\n"
"\n"
">在世界的起源处，只有一个人和广阔的特别是干燥的草地，被七个照亮世界的太阳烧毁。这个人，一个非常好的弓箭手，向众神许诺他刺穿了所有这些太阳，甚至一次都没有错过任何目标。如果他失败了，他会一拳切破自己的手指，然后像土拨鼠一样住在一个洞里，以避开会给他带来沉重负担的诅咒。他鞠躬，拉了第一个箭，击中了目标。一秒，三分之一，直到第六个摧毁了太阳。当吞下的燕子飞过并通过它的方向时，他将第七根箭头拉向最后的太阳而结束。那只鸟被击中了。这个人没有达到他的目标，所以他离开了一个洞，被放逐，割断了手指，变成了土拨鼠。燕子刚刚拯救了我们的太阳，否则所有生命将从世界表面消失。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"我们必须在这里看到与数字7相似的数字，它在蒙古文化中像所有奇数一样重要。他们为佛教带来了运气。\n"
"\n"
"##### 日食\n"
"\n"
">那时，有一个可怕的怪物叫拉阿（Raah），吓坏了整个世界。他吞没了一切。 Orchiwaani神拥有一个神奇的春天：喝了它的人就变得不朽。有一天，拉阿偷走了神奇的春天，喝醉了。月亮和太阳在表演中抓住了怪物，并向Orchiwaani汇报。听到他要去与怪物战斗的这一消息，他怒不可遏。他多次砍了头，但由于拉哈变得不朽，它又立刻长大了。然后，他打算剪掉它的尾巴，以便让所有吃掉的东西直接再次离开。正如Orchiwaani抓住怪物将其完成时一样，它在月球与太阳之间逃脱并消失了。然后Orchiwaani要求月亮帮助，后者重新夺回了Raah，并割下了臀部和尾巴。为了报仇，怪物有时会回来吃月球或太阳，但他们总是立即退出月球。这是月食和日食的神话原因。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"当发生日食时，蒙古人知道这意味着拉哈吞噬了月亮或太阳，并且他们发出很多噪音，以使怪物解放被日食覆盖的怪物。在13世纪，纪尧姆·德·布鲁克（Guillaume de Rubruck）写道[#1]：\n"
"\n"
">一些“ [蒙古人]”具有天文学知识，并向“其他蒙古人”预测了月食和日食，并且在即将发生的时候，每个人都积蓄了食物，因为他们没有通过门他们的住所。当日食发生时，他们会弹鼓和乐器，并发出很大的声音和嘶哑声。当月蚀结束时，他们将全神贯注于饮料和节日，并举行大型聚会。”\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"在2008年，Eclipse旅行者仍然目睹司机和厨师躲在帐篷里，用锅发出声音。看起来很真实，对游客来说不是表演。还要注意拉赫与印度拉胡的相似之处。\n"
"\n"
"##### 仙后座（Hun Tavan Od）\n"
"\n"
"仙后座（匈奴塔凡奥德）象征蒙古人的团结，兄弟情谊和团结。这个星座的五颗星代表成吉思汗的妻子Oulin的五个孩子的团结。\n"
"\n"
">他们彼此相处不好，一直吵架。他们的母亲决定强力系好五根绳子，每根绳子都应尝试解开结。如果他们成功了，那就意味着他们不会与其他人保持团结，兄弟会也不会在困难时期聚集。相反，如果这两个结节经受住了考验，那么这五个兄弟将在以后的生活中保持团结一致，并在战争中取得胜利。\n"
">\n"
"\n"
"#### 与天空相关的其他信仰\n"
"\n"
"根据蒙古的传说，一个献身于天空中一百颗星星的女人会梦见自己未来的丈夫。\n"
"\n"
"有时，蒙古人会向牛奶熊方向投掷牛奶，以此来纪念大熊（Doloon Burkhan）。白色的牛奶象征着蒙古的纯正。他们祈祷以便有所成就，但对于几个人，而不只是一个人，因为这会带来厄运。牛奶可以用伏特加代替，因为伏特加无色，象征着深色和蒙古人的力量。这样可以避免厄运，争吵，恐惧并抵御邪灵。\n"
"\n"
"### 结论\n"
"\n"
"这些星座的灵感来自西方国家，但蒙古宇宙论在此简要介绍，突显了与之相关的著名信仰。蒙古的文化和知识传播基本上是口头的，因此关于这些主题的书面痕迹很少。因此，特别难于将它们的外观与高保真度和精度相关联。为了保留有关此宇宙论的知识，欢迎任何观察，建议或合作！\n"
