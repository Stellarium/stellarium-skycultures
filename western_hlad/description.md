# Modern (O.Hlad,1988)

## Introduction

This Czech print atlas was commonly used in the pre-digital era and, therefore, displays canonical modern constellations that had been defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1928.  

## Description

The constellations in this sky culture follow the 88 IAU-constellations but the lines connect only bright stars. The sky culture addresses the modern city downtown inhabitant in a light polluted environement.

This set of stickfigures reproduces the classical Czech publication: Hlad, Hovorka, Polechová, Weiselová (1988): Hvězdná obloha 2000.0. Praha: Geodetický a kartografický podnik - according to classical Czech publication [#1]. This is a folder of loose sheets (62x46cm) with 85,000 celestial objects and very decent line prints of the modern constellations.

There are (rather similar) Czech and Slovak references: [#2] and [#3]. 

The atlas contains not only stars but also deep sky objects and transients (novae and supernovae); newer editions are based on the data hosted online by the Centre des données stellaires, Observatoire de Strasbourg. 

These Czech constellation lines are designed to basically connect stars with Greek-letter (α, β, γ, ...) designations, which are the brightest stars of the constellations. In some cases, similarly bright stars without such position in the classical Greek figure are included, especially when they form a mnemotechnic figure (like the 'W' in case of Cas, or 'hurdles-runner' instead of Vir).

Usually, only star brighter than 5th magnitude are used because the fainter ones are difficult to spot in towns. The resulting figures are also a bit simpler and easier-to-remember for children. These constellations are used at the Observatory and Planetarium Hradec Králové in the Czech Republic.

Notes on deviations from the commonly known depiction:

   * UMa is taken from Pittich and Kalmančok (1981); M81 and M82 galaxies are just behind Bear's head.
   * Gem is a similar case.
   * Cam appears upside-down compared to the traditional mythological figure, but HIP 29997, 33694 stars are indeed brighter.
