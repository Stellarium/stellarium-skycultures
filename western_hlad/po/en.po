"This atlas [#1] is is a folder of loose sheets (62x46cm) with 85,000 celestial\n"
"objects and very decent line prints of the modern constellations.\n"
"\n"
"The constellations in this sky culture follow the 88 IAU-constellations. Only\n"
"stars brighter than 5th magnitude are used because the fainter ones are\n"
"difficult to spot in towns. The resulting lines are also a bit simpler and\n"
"easier-to-remember for children. These constellations are used at the\n"
"Observatory and Planetarium Hradec Králové in the Czech Republic.\n"
"\n"
"The atlas contains not only stars but also deep sky objects and transients\n"
"(novae and supernovae); newer editions are based on the data hosted online by\n"
"the Centre des données stellaires, Observatoire de Strasbourg.\n"
"\n"
"These Czech constellation lines are designed to basically connect stars with\n"
"Greek-letter (α, β, γ, ...) designations, which are the brightest stars of the\n"
"constellations. In some cases, similarly bright stars without such position in\n"
"the classical Greek figure are included, especially when they form a\n"
"mnemotechnic figure (like the 'W' of Cassiopeia, or 'hurdles-runner' instead\n"
"of Virgo).\n"
"\n"
"There are (rather similar) Czech and Slovak references: [#2] and [#3].\n"
"\n"
"Notes on deviations from the commonly known depiction:\n"
"\n"
" * UMa is taken from Pittich and Kalmančok (1981); M81 and M82 galaxies are\n"
"just behind Bear's head.\n"
" * Gem is a similar case.\n"
" * Cam appears upside-down compared to the traditional mythological figure,\n"
"but HIP 29997, 33694 stars are indeed brighter."
