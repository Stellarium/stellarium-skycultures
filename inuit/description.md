# Inuit

## Introduction

The Inuit are the indigene peoples in the arctic areas of America, i.e. central and northeast Canada and Greenland. Their culture is part of the various cultures but the term "Eskimo" refers to a much larger group (also including peoples from Alasca and on both sides of the Behring Strait). 

## Description

 This sky culture for Stellarium is an adaptation of John MacDonald's research in his book __The Arctic Sky: Inuit Astronomy, Star Lore and Legend__. While placements and specifics of Inuit constellations might differ from tribe to tribe, the information in Stellarium presents the constellations and general themes of the arctic universe.

## References
