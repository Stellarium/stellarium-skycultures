## Introduction

The Maori (New Zealand) night sky is similar to the Polynesian night sky. But it differs enough to warrant it's own sky culture. Maritime themes are central to the Maori sky culture and were used extensively in nautical navigation. Along with most other cultures, the rising and setting of prominent stars were used to signal planting and harvesting seasons.
