## Introduction

The Maori (New Zealand) night sky is similar to the Polynesian night sky, but
differs enough to warrant its own sky culture. Maritime themes are central to
the Maori sky culture and were used extensively in nautical navigation. Like
for most other sky cultures, the rising and setting of prominent stars were
used to signal planting and harvesting seasons.

## Description

Only four constellations are known from the native navigators of New Zealand.
