<h1>Siddhar Iyal</h1>
<p>
The Siddhar Iyal celestial tradition originates from the "Siddhar Iyal" framework, delineating the cosmic expanse into 12 constellations, each spanning precisely 30 degrees, and 27 stars, each with a fixed magnitude of 13.2 degrees segmented into 4 Padams. This structured approach empowered agrarians to anticipate optimal periods for planting and harvesting, consequently enhancing agricultural productivity. Beyond agriculture, this system offered insights into celestial body positions and their purported influence on human destinies.

Crafted by Tamil Siddhars, who employed three sticks for sky observation, this system facilitated the discernment of stars, planets, moon, and sun, illuminating connections to human existence and the natural order. Its inception stemmed from the Siddhars' profound comprehension of the cosmos, honed through meticulous observation and interpretation of astral movements. The Siddhar Iyal system stands as a testament to Tamil Nadu's rich reservoir of ancestral wisdom and knowledge transmission.

The contributions of Tamil Siddhars to celestial sciences have profoundly shaped the cultural and intellectual landscape of the region, perpetuating a legacy that continues to inspire contemporary scholars and researchers.
