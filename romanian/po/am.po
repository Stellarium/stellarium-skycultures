"Romania is a land in southeast Europe. Romanian popular stellar mythology is a\n"
"mixture of several historical epochs from pre-Christian to modern."

#. Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Considered as a whole, Romanian popular stellar mythology has three essential\n"
"components:\n"
"\n"
"1. The ancestral pastoral-agricultural culture: in this pre-Christian culture,\n"
"the sky is seen both as an agrarian clock for specific activities and as an\n"
"\"exhibition\" of agricultural tools used by peasants.\n"
"\n"
"2. More recently, corresponding to the Christianization of Romanian\n"
"geographical space, there was also a repositioning in the sky: Christian and\n"
"pre-Christian elements and constellations are associated with cosmogonical and\n"
"theogonical myths, so that the sky is seen more like a church.\n"
"\n"
"3. The origin of the Romanian people: historical scenes from the conquest of\n"
"Dacia by the Romans are projected in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"One of the differences between the Romanian and the modern sky culture is in\n"
"the constellation of Orion, the Hunter. There are four traditional Romanian\n"
"constellations overlapping in this modern constellation area.\n"
