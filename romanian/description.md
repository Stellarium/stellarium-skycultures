# Romanian

## Introduction

Romania is a land in southeast Europe. Romanian popular stellar mythology is a
mixture of several historical epochs from pre-Christian to modern.

## Description

Considered as a whole, Romanian popular stellar mythology has three essential
components:

1. The ancestral pastoral-agricultural culture: in this pre-Christian culture,
the sky is seen both as an agrarian clock for specific activities and as an
"exhibition" of agricultural tools used by peasants.

2. More recently, corresponding to the Christianization of Romanian
geographical space, there was also a repositioning in the sky: Christian and
pre-Christian elements and constellations are associated with cosmogonical and
theogonical myths, so that the sky is seen more like a church.

3. The origin of the Romanian people: this people was formed after the conquest
of Dacia by the Romans. Dramatic scenes from this history of Dacians mixing
with the Romans are projected in the sky.

One of the differences between the Romanian and the modern sky culture is in
the constellation of Orion, the Hunter. There are four traditional Romanian
constellations overlapping in this modern constellation area.
