# Book Of The Stars (Almagest)

## Introduction
This sky culture reflects Ptolemy Almagest constellations and tables of _Book Of The Stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب), written by the astronomer: Al-Ṣūfī in the 10th century. The book describes the 1025 stars of the 48 classical Greek constellations and map to them the indigenous Arab star names and asterisms.

## Description
_Book of the stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب) is an astronomical book written shortly before 964 by the astronomer Abu al-Ḥusayn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿUmar al-Ṣūfī (born in Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Ṣūfī. It is the most outstanding among the works of the prominent astronomer, as Professor Paul Kunitzsch described it. Professor Kunitzsch continued to say  [^1]:
>In it, al-Ṣūfī treats the 48 classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation and its individual stars; this section also includes al-Ṣūfi's criticism of the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation, and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star catalogue in the Almagest.

In addition to the four sections of each constellation mentioned by dr. Kunitzsch, al-Ṣūfī would identify stars within the 6 magnitudes that were neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and was faithful to Ptolemy star catalog.

An important aspect of the general discussion section of each constellation is al-Ṣūfī method of facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in more than one way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like a triangle or an arc shape, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 angular distances measured by al-Ṣūfī in his book. The units he uses for angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. Al-Ṣūfī explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and 20 minutes[^2]. For the other units, Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I came up with different ones. The following table summarizes the units and relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup[^3] and from my research.

### Angular distance units used by al-Ṣūfī

|   |Schjellerup||Khalid|| 
|----|------|------|-------------|-------------|
|unit|cubits|Angular Value|cubits|Angular Value|
|spear|6 cubits|14°|6 cubits|14°|
|Man-Height|||3 cubits|7°|
|cubit|1 cubit|2°20'|1 cubit|2°20'|
|span|1/3 of a cubit|47'|1/2 of a cubit|1°10'|
|finger|1/32 of a cubit|4.4'|1/16 of a cubit|8.75'|

## Constellations
The sky culture contains the 48 Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy in the Almagest plus three constellations imagined by al-Ṣūfī and were illustrated in his book.

### Compilation of the sky culture

This sky culture is a result of research done on manuscripts of al-Ṣūfī book, oldest of which is the [Oxford, Bodleian Library Ms. Marsh 144 dated 1009 AD](https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/viewer/c1caa84c-f6d2-483f-9eb4-2439cccdc801#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=25&r=0&xywh=-4815%2C-378%2C14782%2C7535).
Ten manuscripts of the _The Book Of The Stars_ were consulted to produce the most accurate text as was written by al-Ṣūfī. Then, each member star of the 48 constellations was identified according to al-Ṣūfī description, and new tables were built including modern star designations from the Hipparcos, Bright stars, and Bayer catalogues. In addition, Arab indigenous star names were collected and identified as mapped by al-Ṣūfī to the Ptolemaic ones. All the previous steps were included in a book published digitally of the _The Book Of The Stars_ plus explanations and commentary by Khalid al-Ajaji, the author of this sky culture[^4].

The sky culture art images of the constellations were extracted from the Ulugh Beg manuscript of the _The Book Of The Stars_, and adapted for Stellarium by Mr. Kutaibaa Akraa [^5]. The star names list includes the star number in the constellation as the primary star name and the description of the star in the tables as a secondary name. For example, Polaris primary name that is displayed with the star is: UMi 1, UMi being Ursa Minor and 1 is the first star of this constellation. If the star is selected other secondary names are displayed, which will display _The star on the end of the tail_, the description of this star as it appears in Almagest tables. The constellation lines are constructed according to the constellation shapes with an attempt to include most of the member stars. For indigenous Arab star knowledge, individual star names were added to the star definition as secondary names.

The translation of star descriptions from Arabic into English was extracted from Ernie Wright website[^6] which was transcribed from Toomer's translation of the Almagest[^7]. The translation was modified in a few places to agree with al-Ṣūfī wording.

The single source of the sky culture is the _The book of the stars_ and the aim is to give a faithful representation of the book content.
