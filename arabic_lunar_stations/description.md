# Arabic (Lunar Stations)

## Introduction

The Arabic lunar stations describes the 28 sky areas chosen in ancient Arabia
to define the daily location of the moon during its monthly trip around the
sky.

## Description

#### Historical Overview

Originally, _Manazil al-Qamar_, the Arabic for the lunar mansions, or stations
of the moon, were a system of 28 stars, group of stars, or spots in the sky
near which the moon can be found in each of the 28 nights of its monthly
revolution. Early mentions of the complete list of the lunar stations are
reported by ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Ḥabīb (d. 852) on the authority of Malik ibn Anas
(d. 795) [#1]. However, this system had been adopted already in the pre-Islamic
period, prior to the 7th century of the common era.

Using heliacal observations, the asterisms of the lunar mansions served to
divide the sidereal and solar year of 365 days into 28 periods of 13 days each
except for one period that is given 14 days. These 28 periods are called
_anwāʾ_, plural of _nawʾ_. Each _nawʾ_ is determined by a characteristical
star: when this star rises in the morning during dawn (in the east, so, shortly
before the Sun), this is the beginning of the next _nawʾ_. The name of the
_nawʾ_ (period of time, half month), gives the lunar mansion its name. One
complete cycle of setting and rising for each of the 28 lunar mansions, one
after the other, makes a solar year. This system was used to determine the
seasons and predict weather, especially rain [#2]. The Arabs said: each _nawʾ_
(period of 13/14 days) is characterized by a distinctive weather pattern of
rain, wind, and temperature [#4].

A detailed description of the stars of each lunar mansion, the times of their
heliacal rising and a compilation of astronomical and meteorological knowledge
of the ancient Arabs can be found in the _Book of al-anwaʾ_, authored by Ibn
Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889). Copies of this book manuscripts survived,
and it was printed in India in 1956 [#5].

The usage of the lunar mansions continued to schedule the times of
agricultural, travel and medicine practices. Due to the importance of observing
the times of their heliacal risings, short treatises have been written, and
poems have been composed describing the asterisms of the 28 mansions. A poem
dedicated to description of the stars of the lunar mansions was published by
Gustave-Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski in 1899 in his book "Les mansions
lunaires chez les Arabes", attributed to Muḥammad al-Muqrī (1578-1638)
[#6][#7]. A sample treatise is the one written by Shaykh Ṣāliḥ al-Shuthrī (d.
~1891), titled "A time-table for farmers" [#8].

#### Current Usage of Lunar Stations

Agricultural almanacs based on the heliacal rising of lunar stations are still
in active use today. The official calendar of Saudi Arabia includes these times
[#9]. The following is an example of the use of a calendar based on the lunar
stations for the 13 days period starting with the rise of the 3rd lunar station
_al-Thurayya_ (Pleiades) on June 7th [#10]:

> Weather gets hotter and wind gets stronger. Wild grasses dry. Water in wells
> gets shallower. Rain is rare during this time. Spring insects start to
> disappear. Palm tree dates starts to get its colors. It is recommended to
> irrigate trees with the right amounts and stop irrigation of vines when
> grapes start to get its color.

#### Identification of the Lunar Stations

Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889) in his _Book of al-anwaʾ_ gives detailed
description of the stars of each lunar station, while an accurate
identification can be extracted from the _Book of the stars_ by al-Ṣūfī (d.
986). In his book, al-Ṣūfī maps the stars as known to ancient Arabs to those of
the Ptolemaic Constellations.

An example of al-Ṣūfī definitions of the stars of the lunar mansions, here is
the definition of _al-Ghafr_ [#11][#12]:

> And the 22nd \[star of Virgo\] and the 23rd which is on the tail
> \[hem of the garment\] with the 25th on the left foot \[of Virgo\] are named
> \[by the Arabs\] _al-Ghafr_ which is the 15th lunar mansion.

Because the stars of the Ptolemaic constellations have known coordinates, it is
relatively easy to identify the Arab star names.

##### The Super lion and Al-Jawza figures of the ancient Arab star lore

One may notice from the names of the 7th to the 15th lunar stations that they
are part of a lion figure. This Arab lion figure covers around 100 degrees, a
little bit more than half of the sky dome. From the names of these stars a lion
figure can be constructed. 

Two of the lunar stations, _Al-Hakaah_ and _Al-Hanaah_, are part of Al-Jawza
stars. Al-Jawza is the figure covering Orion plus some stars around it. The
ancient Arabs imagined these stars as a figure of a woman with a bow and arrow
aimed at the lion (an image, probably influenced from Roman Egypt: see
depiction on Denderah zodiac which shows Babylonian as well as Greek traces of
constellations).

Mr. Roland Laffitte discussed these two figures and offered a depiction of each
in his article: [Our Arab Heritage in the CelestialVault](http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/our-arab-heritage-celestial-vault).
A more detailed discussion of ancient Arab star lore is found in his book: "Le
Ciel des Arabes" [#13].
