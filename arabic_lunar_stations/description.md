# Book Of The Stars (Traditional Arabic)

## Introduction
This sky culture reflects the traditional Arabic star names, constellations and asterisms identified by the prominent astronomer: al-Ṣūfī in his _Book Of The Stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب), written in the 10th century. The book maps the Arab names to the respective stars of the 48 classical Greek constellations in Ptolemy's Almagest.

## Description
_Book Of The Stars_ (Arabic:كتاب الكواكب) is an astronomical book written shortly before 964 by the astronomer Abu al-Ḥusayn ʻAbd Al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Ṣūfī (born in Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Ṣūfī. It is the most outstanding among the works of the prominent astronomer, as Professor Paul Kunitzsch described it [^1]. In the book, al-Ṣūfī treats the 48 classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in Ptolemy's Almagest. For each constellation, a chapter is dedicated that includes the following four sections: 
1. A general discussion of the constellation and its individual stars; this section also includes al-Ṣūfī's criticism of the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations.
2. A record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under the constellation, and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars.
3. Two drawings of the constellation, one as it is seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky.
4. A table of the stars making up the constellation, giving a verbal description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star catalogue in the Almagest.

An important aspect of al-Ṣūfī book is his record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under each constellation, and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars. This means that we are looking at two layers of stars knowledge at the same time: the Ptolemaic one and the indigenous Arab one.

The sky culture images reresent the Greek constellations and were extracted from the Ulugh Beg manuscript of the _The Book Of The Stars_, and adapted for Stellarium by Mr. Kutaibaa Akraa [^3]. The indigenous ancient Arabs constellations, asterisms and stars are defined by names and lines according to al-Ṣūfī description.

The single source of the sky culture is the _The Book Of The Stars_ and the aim is to give a faithful representation of the book content.

## Constellations
This sky culture displays the Arabic constellations as lines superimposed on the images of the Ptolemaic constellations according to al-Sufi description in his _Book Of The Stars_. All Arabic names of the stars mentioned by al-Sufi are included.

### Compilation of the sky culture
This sky culture is a result of research done on manuscripts of al-Ṣūfī book, oldest of which is the [Oxford, Bodleian Library Ms. Marsh 144 dated 1009 AD](https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/viewer/c1caa84c-f6d2-483f-9eb4-2439cccdc801#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=25&r=0&xywh=-4815%2C-378%2C14782%2C7535).
Ten manuscripts of the _The Book Of The Stars_ were consulted to produce the most accurate text as was written by al-Ṣūfī. Then, each member star of the 48 constellations was identified according to al-Ṣūfī description, and new tables were built including modern star designations from the Hipparcos, Bright stars, and Bayer catalogues. In addition, Arab indigenous star names were collected and identified as mapped by al-Ṣūfī to the Ptolemaic ones. All the previous steps were included in a book published digitally of the _The Book Of The Stars_ plus explanations and commentary by Khalid al-Ajaji, the author of this sky culture[^2].
