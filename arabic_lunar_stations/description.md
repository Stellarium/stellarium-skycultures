# Arabic Lunar Stations

## Introduction
The Arabic lunar stations describes the 28 sky areas chosen in ancient Arabia to define the daily location of the moon during its monthly trip around the sky.
## Description

#### Historical Overview
Originally, the _Manazil al-Qamar_, the Arabic for the lunar mansions, or stations of the moon, were a system of 28 stars, group of stars, or spots in the sky near which the moon can be found in each of the 28 nights of its monthly revolution. Early mentions of the complete list of the lunar stations are reported by Abd al-Malik Ibn Habeeb (d. 852) on the authority of Malik ibn Anas (d. 795) [^1]. However, this system had been adopted already in the pre-Islamic period, prior to the 7th century of the common era.
Using heliacal observations, the asterisms of the lunar mansions served to divide the sidereal and solar year of 365 days into 28 periods of 13 days each except for one period that is given 14 days. These 28 periods are called _Anwa'a_, plural of _Nawa'a_. Each _Nawa'a_ is determined by a characteristical star: when this star rises in the morning during dawn (in the east, so, shortly before the Sun), this is the beginning of the next _Nawa'a_. The name of the _Nawa'a_ (period of time, half month), gives the lunar mansion its name. One complete cycle of setting and rising for each of the 28 lunar mansions, one after the other, makes a solar year. This system was used to determine the seasons and predict weather, especially rain [^2]. The Arabs said: each _Nawa'a_ (period of 13/14 days) is characterized by a distinctive weather pattern of rain, wind, and temperature [^4].
A detailed description of the stars of each lunar mansion, the times of their heliacal rising and a compilation of astronomical and meteorological knowledge of the ancient Arabs can be found in the _Book of Anwaa_, authored by Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889). Copies of this book manuscripts survived, and it was printed in India in 1956 [^5].
The usage of the lunar mansions continued to schedule the times of agricultural, travel and medicine practices. 
Due to the importance of observing the times of their heliacal risings, short treatises have been written, and poems have been composed describing the asterisms of the 28 mansions. A poem dedicated to description of the stars of the lunar mansions was published by Gustave-Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski in 1899 in his book "Les mansions lunaires chez les Arabes", attributed to Muhammad al-Mukri (1578-1638) [^6][^7]. A sample treatise is the one written by Shaikh Salih Al-Shethri (d. ~1891), titled "A time-table for farmers" [^8].
#### Current Usage of Lunar Stations
Agricultural almanacs based on the heliacal rising of lunar stations are still in active use today. The official calendar of Saudi Arabia includes these times [^9]. The following is an example of the use of a calendar based on the lunar stations for the 13 days period starting with the rise of the 3rd lunar station _Al-Thurayya_ (Pleiades) on June 7th: "Weather gets hotter and wind gets stronger. Wild grasses dry. Water in wells gets shallower. Rain is rare during this time. Spring insects start to disappear. Palm tree dates starts to get its colors. It is recommended to irrigate trees with the right amounts and stop irrigation of vines when grapes start to get its color."[^10]
#### Identification of the Lunar Stations
Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889) in his _Book of Anwaa_ gives detailed description of the stars of each lunar station while an accurate identification can be extracted from the _Book of Fixed Stars_ by Al-Sufi (d. 986). In his book, Al-Sufi maps the stars as known to ancient Arabs to those of the Ptolemaic Constellations.
An example of Al-Sufi definitions of the stars of the lunar mansions, here is the definition of _Al-Ghafr_: "And the 22nd \[star of Virgo\] and the 23rd which is on the tail \[hem of the garment\] with the 25th on the left foot \[of Virgo\] are named \[by the Arabs\] _Al-Ghafr_ which is the 15th lunar mansion."[^11][^12]. Because the stars of the Ptolemaic constellations have known coordinates, it is relatively easy to identify the Arab star names.

##### The Super lion and Al-Jawza figures of the ancient Arab star lore
One may notice from the names of the 7th to the 15th lunar stations that they are part of a lion figure. This Arab lion figure covers around 100 degrees, a little bit more than half of the sky dome. From the names of these stars a lion figure can be constructed.
Two of the lunar stations, _Al-Hakaah_ and _Al-Hanaah_, are part of Al-Jawza stars. Al-Jawza is the figure covering Orion plus some stars around it. The ancient Arabs imagined these stars as a figure of a woman with a bow and arrow aimed at the lion (an image, probably influenced from Roman Egypt: see depiction on Denderah zodiac which shows Babylonian as well as Greek traces of constellations).
Mr. Roland Laffitte discussed these two figures and offered a depiction of each in his article: [Our Arab Heritage in the CelestialVault](http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/our-arab-heritage-celestial-vault). A more detailed discussion of ancient Arab star lore is found in his book: "Le Ciel des Arabes" [^26].
